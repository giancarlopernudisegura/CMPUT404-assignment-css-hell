			THE STRANGE MAN&rsquo;S ARRIVAL</h2>

		<p>
			The stranger came early in February, one wintry day, through a biting wind and
			a driving snow, the last snowfall of the year, over the down, walking from
			Bramblehurst railway station, and carrying a little black portmanteau in his
			thickly gloved hand. He was wrapped up from head to foot, and the brim of his
			soft felt hat hid every inch of his face but the shiny tip of his nose; the
			snow had piled itself against his shoulders and chest, and added a white crest
			to the burden he carried. He staggered into the &ldquo;Coach and Horses&rdquo;
			more dead than alive, and flung his portmanteau down. &ldquo;A fire,&rdquo; he
			cried, &ldquo;in the name of human charity! A room and a fire!&rdquo; He
			stamped and shook the snow from off himself in the bar, and followed Mrs. Hall
			into her guest parlour to strike his bargain. And with that much introduction,
			that and a couple of sovereigns flung upon the table, he took up his quarters
			in the inn.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mrs. Hall lit the fire and left him there while she went to prepare him a meal
			with her own hands. A guest to stop at Iping in the wintertime was an
			unheard-of piece of luck, let alone a guest who was no &ldquo;haggler,&rdquo;
			and she was resolved to show herself worthy of her good fortune. As soon as the
			bacon was well under way, and Millie, her lymphatic maid, had been brisked up a
			bit by a few deftly chosen expressions of contempt, she carried the cloth,
			plates, and glasses into the parlour and began to lay them with the utmost
			<i>&eacute;clat</i>. Although the fire was burning up briskly, she was
			surprised to see that her visitor still wore his hat and coat, standing with
			his back to her and staring out of the window at the falling snow in the yard.
			His gloved hands were clasped behind him, and he seemed to be lost in thought.
			She noticed that the melting snow that still sprinkled his shoulders dripped
			upon her carpet. &ldquo;Can I take your hat and coat, sir?&rdquo; she said,
			&ldquo;and give them a good dry in the kitchen?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said without turning.
		</p>

		<p>
			She was not sure she had heard him, and was about to repeat her question.
		</p>

		<p>
			He turned his head and looked at her over his shoulder. &ldquo;I prefer to keep
			them on,&rdquo; he said with emphasis, and she noticed that he wore big blue
			spectacles with sidelights, and had a bush side-whisker over his coat-collar
			that completely hid his cheeks and face.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;<i>As</i> you like. In a bit the
			room will be warmer.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He made no answer, and had turned his face away from her again, and Mrs. Hall,
			feeling that her conversational advances were ill-timed, laid the rest of the
			table things in a quick staccato and whisked out of the room. When she returned
			he was still standing there, like a man of stone, his back hunched, his collar
			turned up, his dripping hat-brim turned down, hiding his face and ears
			completely. She put down the eggs and bacon with considerable emphasis, and
			called rather than said to him, &ldquo;Your lunch is served, sir.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said at the same time, and did not stir until she
			was closing the door. Then he swung round and approached the table with a
			certain eager quickness.
		</p>

		<p>
			As she went behind the bar to the kitchen she heard a sound repeated at regular
			intervals. Chirk, chirk, chirk, it went, the sound of a spoon being rapidly
			whisked round a basin. &ldquo;That girl!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There! I clean
			forgot it. It&rsquo;s her being so long!&rdquo; And while she herself finished
			mixing the mustard, she gave Millie a few verbal stabs for her excessive
			slowness. She had cooked the ham and eggs, laid the table, and done everything,
			while Millie (help indeed!) had only succeeded in delaying the mustard. And him
			a new guest and wanting to stay! Then she filled the mustard pot, and, putting
			it with a certain stateliness upon a gold and black tea-tray, carried it into
			the parlour.
		</p>

		<p>
			She rapped and entered promptly. As she did so her visitor moved quickly, so
			that she got but a glimpse of a white object disappearing behind the table. It
			would seem he was picking something from the floor. She rapped down the mustard
			pot on the table, and then she noticed the overcoat and hat had been taken off
			and put over a chair in front of the fire, and a pair of wet boots threatened
			rust to her steel fender. She went to these things resolutely. &ldquo;I suppose
			I may have them to dry now,&rdquo; she said in a voice that brooked no denial.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Leave the hat,&rdquo; said her visitor, in a muffled voice, and turning
			she saw he had raised his head and was sitting and looking at her.
		</p>

		<p>
			For a moment she stood gaping at him, too surprised to speak.
		</p>

		<p>
			He held a white cloth&mdash;it was a serviette he had brought with
			him&mdash;over the lower part of his face, so that his mouth and jaws were
			completely hidden, and that was the reason of his muffled voice. But it was not
			that which startled Mrs. Hall. It was the fact that all his forehead above his
			blue glasses was covered by a white bandage, and that another covered his ears,
			leaving not a scrap of his face exposed excepting only his pink, peaked nose.
			It was bright, pink, and shiny just as it had been at first. He wore a
			dark-brown velvet jacket with a high, black, linen-lined collar turned up about
			his neck. The thick black hair, escaping as it could below and between the
			cross bandages, projected in curious tails and horns, giving him the strangest
			appearance conceivable. This muffled and bandaged head was so unlike what she
			had anticipated, that for a moment she was rigid.
		</p>

		<p>
			He did not remove the serviette, but remained holding it, as she saw now, with
			a brown gloved hand, and regarding her with his inscrutable blue glasses.
			&ldquo;Leave the hat,&rdquo; he said, speaking very distinctly through the
			white cloth.
		</p>

		<p>
			Her nerves began to recover from the shock they had received. She placed the
			hat on the chair again by the fire. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; she
			began, &ldquo;that&mdash;&rdquo; and she stopped embarrassed.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said drily, glancing from her to the door and then
			at her again.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have them nicely dried, sir, at once,&rdquo; she said, and
			carried his clothes out of the room. She glanced at his white-swathed head and
			blue goggles again as she was going out of the door; but his napkin was still
			in front of his face. She shivered a little as she closed the door behind her,
			and her face was eloquent of her surprise and perplexity. &ldquo;I
			<i>never</i>,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;There!&rdquo; She went quite softly
			to the kitchen, and was too preoccupied to ask Millie what she was messing
			about with <i>now</i>, when she got there.
		</p>

		<p>
			The visitor sat and listened to her retreating feet. He glanced inquiringly at
			the window before he removed his serviette, and resumed his meal. He took a
			mouthful, glanced suspiciously at the window, took another mouthful, then rose
			and, taking the serviette in his hand, walked across the room and pulled the
			blind down to the top of the white muslin that obscured the lower panes. This
			left the room in a twilight. This done, he returned with an easier air to the
			table and his meal.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;The poor soul&rsquo;s had an accident or an op&rsquo;ration or
			somethin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hall. &ldquo;What a turn them bandages did
			give me, to be sure!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			She put on some more coal, unfolded the clothes-horse, and extended the
			traveller&rsquo;s coat upon this. &ldquo;And they goggles! Why, he looked more
			like a divin&rsquo; helmet than a human man!&rdquo; She hung his muffler on a
			corner of the horse. &ldquo;And holding that handkerchief over his mouth all
			the time. Talkin&rsquo; through it! ... Perhaps his mouth was hurt
			too&mdash;maybe.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			She turned round, as one who suddenly remembers. &ldquo;Bless my soul
			alive!&rdquo; she said, going off at a tangent; &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t you done
			them taters <i>yet</i>, Millie?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			When Mrs. Hall went to clear away the stranger&rsquo;s lunch, her idea that his
			mouth must also have been cut or disfigured in the accident she supposed him to
			have suffered, was confirmed, for he was smoking a pipe, and all the time that
			she was in the room he never loosened the silk muffler he had wrapped round the
			lower part of his face to put the mouthpiece to his lips. Yet it was not
			forgetfulness, for she saw he glanced at it as it smouldered out. He sat in the
			corner with his back to the window-blind and spoke now, having eaten and drunk
			and being comfortably warmed through, with less aggressive brevity than before.
			The reflection of the fire lent a kind of red animation to his big spectacles
			they had lacked hitherto.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I have some luggage,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;at Bramblehurst
			station,&rdquo; and he asked her how he could have it sent. He bowed his
			bandaged head quite politely in acknowledgment of her explanation.
			&ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is no speedier delivery?&rdquo;
			and seemed quite disappointed when she answered, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Was she
			quite sure? No man with a trap who would go over?
		</p>

		<p>
			Mrs. Hall, nothing loath, answered his questions and developed a conversation.
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a steep road by the down, sir,&rdquo; she said in answer to
			the question about a trap; and then, snatching at an opening, said, &ldquo;It
			was there a carriage was upsettled, a year ago and more. A gentleman killed,
			besides his coachman. Accidents, sir, happen in a moment, don&rsquo;t
			they?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			But the visitor was not to be drawn so easily. &ldquo;They do,&rdquo; he said
			through his muffler, eyeing her quietly through his impenetrable glasses.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But they take long enough to get well, don&rsquo;t they? ... There was
			my sister&rsquo;s son, Tom, jest cut his arm with a scythe, tumbled on it in
			the &rsquo;ayfield, and, bless me! he was three months tied up sir. You&rsquo;d
			hardly believe it. It&rsquo;s regular given me a dread of a scythe, sir.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I can quite understand that,&rdquo; said the visitor.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;He was afraid, one time, that he&rsquo;d have to have an
			op&rsquo;ration&mdash;he was that bad, sir.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			The visitor laughed abruptly, a bark of a laugh that he seemed to bite and kill
			in his mouth. &ldquo;<i>Was</i> he?&rdquo; he said.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;He was, sir. And no laughing matter to them as had the doing for him, as
			I had&mdash;my sister being took up with her little ones so much. There was
			bandages to do, sir, and bandages to undo. So that if I may make so bold as to
			say it, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Will you get me some matches?&rdquo; said the visitor, quite abruptly.
			&ldquo;My pipe is out.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Mrs. Hall was pulled up suddenly. It was certainly rude of him, after telling
			him all she had done. She gasped at him for a moment, and remembered the two
			sovereigns. She went for the matches.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said concisely, as she put them down, and turned his
			shoulder upon her and stared out of the window again. It was altogether too
			discouraging. Evidently he was sensitive on the topic of operations and
			bandages. She did not &ldquo;make so bold as to say,&rdquo; however, after all.
			But his snubbing way had irritated her, and Millie had a hot time of it that
			afternoon.
		</p>

		<p>
			The visitor remained in the parlour until four o&rsquo;clock, without giving
			the ghost of an excuse for an intrusion. For the most part he was quite still
			during that time; it would seem he sat in the growing darkness smoking in the
			firelight&mdash;perhaps dozing.
		</p>

		<p>
			Once or twice a curious listener might have heard him at the coals, and for the
			space of five minutes he was audible pacing the room. He seemed to be talking
			to himself. Then the armchair creaked as he sat down again.

		<h2><a name="chap02"></a>CHAPTER II.<br />
			MR. TEDDY HENFREY&rsquo;S FIRST IMPRESSIONS</h2>

		<p>
			At four o&rsquo;clock, when it was fairly dark and Mrs. Hall was screwing up
			her courage to go in and ask her visitor if he would take some tea, Teddy
			Henfrey, the clock-jobber, came into the bar. &ldquo;My sakes! Mrs.
			Hall,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but this is terrible weather for thin
			boots!&rdquo; The snow outside was falling faster.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mrs. Hall agreed, and then noticed he had his bag with him. &ldquo;Now
			you&rsquo;re here, Mr. Teddy,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad if
			you&rsquo;d give th&rsquo; old clock in the parlour a bit of a look. &rsquo;Tis
			going, and it strikes well and hearty; but the hour-hand won&rsquo;t do
			nuthin&rsquo; but point at six.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			And leading the way, she went across to the parlour door and rapped and
			entered.
		</p>

		<p>
			Her visitor, she saw as she opened the door, was seated in the armchair before
			the fire, dozing it would seem, with his bandaged head drooping on one side.
			The only light in the room was the red glow from the fire&mdash;which lit his
			eyes like adverse railway signals, but left his downcast face in
			darkness&mdash;and the scanty vestiges of the day that came in through the open
			door. Everything was ruddy, shadowy, and indistinct to her, the more so since
			she had just been lighting the bar lamp, and her eyes were dazzled. But for a
			second it seemed to her that the man she looked at had an enormous mouth wide
			open&mdash;a vast and incredible mouth that swallowed the whole of the lower
			portion of his face. It was the sensation of a moment: the white-bound head,
			the monstrous goggle eyes, and this huge yawn below it. Then he stirred,
			started up in his chair, put up his hand. She opened the door wide, so that the
			room was lighter, and she saw him more clearly, with the muffler held up to his
			face just as she had seen him hold the serviette before. The shadows, she
			fancied, had tricked her.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Would you mind, sir, this man a-coming to look at the clock, sir?&rdquo;
			she said, recovering from the momentary shock.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Look at the clock?&rdquo; he said, staring round in a drowsy manner, and
			speaking over his hand, and then, getting more fully awake,
			&ldquo;certainly.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Mrs. Hall went away to get a lamp, and he rose and stretched himself. Then came
			the light, and Mr. Teddy Henfrey, entering, was confronted by this bandaged
			person. He was, he says, &ldquo;taken aback.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; said the stranger, regarding him&mdash;as Mr.
			Henfrey says, with a vivid sense of the dark spectacles&mdash;&ldquo;like a
			lobster.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Mr. Henfrey, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s no
			intrusion.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;Though, I
			understand,&rdquo; he said turning to Mrs. Hall, &ldquo;that this room is
			really to be mine for my own private use.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I thought, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hall, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d prefer the
			clock&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;certainly&mdash;but, as a
			rule, I like to be alone and undisturbed.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m really glad to have the clock seen to,&rdquo; he said,
			seeing a certain hesitation in Mr. Henfrey&rsquo;s manner. &ldquo;Very
			glad.&rdquo; Mr. Henfrey had intended to apologise and withdraw, but this
			anticipation reassured him. The stranger turned round with his back to the
			fireplace and put his hands behind his back. &ldquo;And presently,&rdquo; he
			said, &ldquo;when the clock-mending is over, I think I should like to have some
			tea. But not till the clock-mending is over.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Mrs. Hall was about to leave the room&mdash;she made no conversational advances
			this time, because she did not want to be snubbed in front of Mr.
			Henfrey&mdash;when her visitor asked her if she had made any arrangements about
			his boxes at Bramblehurst. She told him she had mentioned the matter to the
			postman, and that the carrier could bring them over on the morrow. &ldquo;You
			are certain that is the earliest?&rdquo; he said.
		</p>

		<p>
			She was certain, with a marked coldness.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I should explain,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;what I was really too cold and
			fatigued to do before, that I am an experimental investigator.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Indeed, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hall, much impressed.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;And my baggage contains apparatus and appliances.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Very useful things indeed they are, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hall.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m very naturally anxious to get on with my inquiries.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Of course, sir.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;My reason for coming to Iping,&rdquo; he proceeded, with a certain
			deliberation of manner, &ldquo;was ... a desire for solitude. I do not wish to
			be disturbed in my work. In addition to my work, an accident&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I thought as much,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hall to herself.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;&mdash;necessitates a certain retirement. My eyes&mdash;are sometimes so
			weak and painful that I have to shut myself up in the dark for hours together.
			Lock myself up. Sometimes&mdash;now and then. Not at present, certainly. At
			such times the slightest disturbance, the entry of a stranger into the room, is
			a source of excruciating annoyance to me&mdash;it is well these things should
			be understood.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hall. &ldquo;And if I might make so
			bold as to ask&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;That I think, is all,&rdquo; said the stranger, with that quietly
			irresistible air of finality he could assume at will. Mrs. Hall reserved her
			question and sympathy for a better occasion.
		</p>

		<p>
			After Mrs. Hall had left the room, he remained standing in front of the fire,
			glaring, so Mr. Henfrey puts it, at the clock-mending. Mr. Henfrey not only
			took off the hands of the clock, and the face, but extracted the works; and he
			tried to work in as slow and quiet and unassuming a manner as possible. He
			worked with the lamp close to him, and the green shade threw a brilliant light
			upon his hands, and upon the frame and wheels, and left the rest of the room
			shadowy. When he looked up, coloured patches swam in his eyes. Being
			constitutionally of a curious nature, he had removed the works&mdash;a quite
			unnecessary proceeding&mdash;with the idea of delaying his departure and
			perhaps falling into conversation with the stranger. But the stranger stood
			there, perfectly silent and still. So still, it got on Henfrey&rsquo;s nerves.
			He felt alone in the room and looked up, and there, grey and dim, was the
			bandaged head and huge blue lenses staring fixedly, with a mist of green spots
			drifting in front of them. It was so uncanny to Henfrey that for a minute they
			remained staring blankly at one another. Then Henfrey looked down again. Very
			uncomfortable position! One would like to say something. Should he remark that
			the weather was very cold for the time of year?
		</p>

		<p>
			He looked up as if to take aim with that introductory shot. &ldquo;The
			weather&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you finish and go?&rdquo; said the rigid figure,
			evidently in a state of painfully suppressed rage. &ldquo;All you&rsquo;ve got
			to do is to fix the hour-hand on its axle. You&rsquo;re simply
			humbugging&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Certainly, sir&mdash;one minute more. I overlooked&mdash;&rdquo; and Mr.
			Henfrey finished and went.
		</p>

		<p>
			But he went feeling excessively annoyed. &ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; said Mr.
			Henfrey to himself, trudging down the village through the thawing snow;
			&ldquo;a man must do a clock at times, surely.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			And again, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t a man look at you?&mdash;Ugly!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			And yet again, &ldquo;Seemingly not. If the police was wanting you you
			couldn&rsquo;t be more wropped and bandaged.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			At Gleeson&rsquo;s corner he saw Hall, who had recently married the
			stranger&rsquo;s hostess at the &ldquo;Coach and Horses,&rdquo; and who now
			drove the Iping conveyance, when occasional people required it, to Sidderbridge
			Junction, coming towards him on his return from that place. Hall had evidently
			been &ldquo;stopping a bit&rdquo; at Sidderbridge, to judge by his driving.
			&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow do, Teddy?&rdquo; he said, passing.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You got a rum un up home!&rdquo; said Teddy.
		</p>

		<p>
			Hall very sociably pulled up. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he asked.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Rum-looking customer stopping at the &lsquo;Coach and
			Horses,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Teddy. &ldquo;My sakes!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			And he proceeded to give Hall a vivid description of his grotesque guest.
			&ldquo;Looks a bit like a disguise, don&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;d like to see a
			man&rsquo;s face if I had him stopping in <i>my</i> place,&rdquo; said Henfrey.
			&ldquo;But women are that trustful&mdash;where strangers are concerned.
			He&rsquo;s took your rooms and he ain&rsquo;t even given a name, Hall.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo; said Hall, who was a man of sluggish
			apprehension.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Teddy. &ldquo;By the week. Whatever he is, you
			can&rsquo;t get rid of him under the week. And he&rsquo;s got a lot of luggage
			coming to-morrow, so he says. Let&rsquo;s hope it won&rsquo;t be stones in
			boxes, Hall.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He told Hall how his aunt at Hastings had been swindled by a stranger with
			empty portmanteaux. Altogether he left Hall vaguely suspicious. &ldquo;Get up,
			old girl,&rdquo; said Hall. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose I must see &rsquo;bout
			this.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Teddy trudged on his way with his mind considerably relieved.
		</p>

		<p>
			Instead of &ldquo;seeing &rsquo;bout it,&rdquo; however, Hall on his return was
			severely rated by his wife on the length of time he had spent in Sidderbridge,
			and his mild inquiries were answered snappishly and in a manner not to the
			point. But the seed of suspicion Teddy had sown germinated in the mind of Mr.
			Hall in spite of these discouragements. &ldquo;You wim&rsquo; don&rsquo;t know
			everything,&rdquo; said Mr. Hall, resolved to ascertain more about the
			personality of his guest at the earliest possible opportunity. And after the
			stranger had gone to bed, which he did about half-past nine, Mr. Hall went very
			aggressively into the parlour and looked very hard at his wife&rsquo;s
			furniture, just to show that the stranger wasn&rsquo;t master there, and
			scrutinised closely and a little contemptuously a sheet of mathematical
			computations the stranger had left. When retiring for the night he instructed
			Mrs. Hall to look very closely at the stranger&rsquo;s luggage when it came
			next day.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You mind your own business, Hall,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hall, &ldquo;and
			I&rsquo;ll mind mine.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			She was all the more inclined to snap at Hall because the stranger was
			undoubtedly an unusually strange sort of stranger, and she was by no means
			assured about him in her own mind. In the middle of the night she woke up
			dreaming of huge white heads like turnips, that came trailing after her, at the
			end of interminable necks, and with vast black eyes. But being a sensible
			woman, she subdued her terrors and turned over and went to sleep again.

		<h2><a name="chap03"></a>CHAPTER III.<br />
			THE THOUSAND AND ONE BOTTLES</h2>

		<p>
			So it was that on the twenty-ninth day of February, at the beginning of the
			thaw, this singular person fell out of infinity into Iping village. Next day
			his luggage arrived through the slush&mdash;and very remarkable luggage it was.
			There were a couple of trunks indeed, such as a rational man might need, but in
			addition there were a box of books&mdash;big, fat books, of which some were
			just in an incomprehensible handwriting&mdash;and a dozen or more crates,
			boxes, and cases, containing objects packed in straw, as it seemed to Hall,
			tugging with a casual curiosity at the straw&mdash;glass bottles. The stranger,
			muffled in hat, coat, gloves, and wrapper, came out impatiently to meet
			Fearenside&rsquo;s cart, while Hall was having a word or so of gossip
			preparatory to helping bring them in. Out he came, not noticing
			Fearenside&rsquo;s dog, who was sniffing in a <i>dilettante</i> spirit at
			Hall&rsquo;s legs. &ldquo;Come along with those boxes,&rdquo; he said.
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting long enough.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			And he came down the steps towards the tail of the cart as if to lay hands on
			the smaller crate.
		</p>

		<p>
			No sooner had Fearenside&rsquo;s dog caught sight of him, however, than it
			began to bristle and growl savagely, and when he rushed down the steps it gave
			an undecided hop, and then sprang straight at his hand. &ldquo;Whup!&rdquo;
			cried Hall, jumping back, for he was no hero with dogs, and Fearenside howled,
			&ldquo;Lie down!&rdquo; and snatched his whip.
		</p>

		<p>
			They saw the dog&rsquo;s teeth had slipped the hand, heard a kick, saw the dog
			execute a flanking jump and get home on the stranger&rsquo;s leg, and heard the
			rip of his trousering. Then the finer end of Fearenside&rsquo;s whip reached
			his property, and the dog, yelping with dismay, retreated under the wheels of
			the waggon. It was all the business of a swift half-minute. No one spoke,
			everyone shouted. The stranger glanced swiftly at his torn glove and at his
			leg, made as if he would stoop to the latter, then turned and rushed swiftly up
			the steps into the inn. They heard him go headlong across the passage and up
			the uncarpeted stairs to his bedroom.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You brute, you!&rdquo; said Fearenside, climbing off the waggon with his
			whip in his hand, while the dog watched him through the wheel. &ldquo;Come
			here,&rdquo; said Fearenside&mdash;&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Hall had stood gaping. &ldquo;He wuz bit,&rdquo; said Hall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
			better go and see to en,&rdquo; and he trotted after the stranger. He met Mrs.
			Hall in the passage. &ldquo;Carrier&rsquo;s darg,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;bit
			en.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He went straight upstairs, and the stranger&rsquo;s door being ajar, he pushed
			it open and was entering without any ceremony, being of a naturally sympathetic
			turn of mind.
		</p>

		<p>
			The blind was down and the room dim. He caught a glimpse of a most singular
			thing, what seemed a handless arm waving towards him, and a face of three huge
			indeterminate spots on white, very like the face of a pale pansy. Then he was
			struck violently in the chest, hurled back, and the door slammed in his face
			and locked. It was so rapid that it gave him no time to observe. A waving of
			indecipherable shapes, a blow, and a concussion. There he stood on the dark
			little landing, wondering what it might be that he had seen.
		</p>

		<p>
			A couple of minutes after, he rejoined the little group that had formed outside
			the &ldquo;Coach and Horses.&rdquo; There was Fearenside telling about it all
			over again for the second time; there was Mrs. Hall saying his dog didn&rsquo;t
			have no business to bite her guests; there was Huxter, the general dealer from
			over the road, interrogative; and Sandy Wadgers from the forge, judicial;
			besides women and children, all of them saying fatuities: &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t
			let en bite <i>me</i>, I knows&rdquo;; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tasn&rsquo;t right
			<i>have</i> such dargs&rdquo;; &ldquo;Whad &rsquo;<i>e</i> bite &rsquo;n for,
			then?&rdquo; and so forth.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mr. Hall, staring at them from the steps and listening, found it incredible
			that he had seen anything so very remarkable happen upstairs. Besides, his
			vocabulary was altogether too limited to express his impressions.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;He don&rsquo;t want no help, he says,&rdquo; he said in answer to his
			wife&rsquo;s inquiry. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better be a-takin&rsquo; of his luggage
			in.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;He ought to have it cauterised at once,&rdquo; said Mr. Huxter;
			&ldquo;especially if it&rsquo;s at all inflamed.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;d shoot en, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d do,&rdquo; said a lady
			in the group.
		</p>

		<p>
			Suddenly the dog began growling again.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; cried an angry voice in the doorway, and there stood
			the muffled stranger with his collar turned up, and his hat-brim bent down.
			&ldquo;The sooner you get those things in the better I&rsquo;ll be
			pleased.&rdquo; It is stated by an anonymous bystander that his trousers and
			gloves had been changed.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Was you hurt, sir?&rdquo; said Fearenside. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rare sorry
			the darg&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;Never broke the skin. Hurry
			up with those things.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He then swore to himself, so Mr. Hall asserts.
		</p>

		<p>
			Directly the first crate was, in accordance with his directions, carried into
			the parlour, the stranger flung himself upon it with extraordinary eagerness,
			and began to unpack it, scattering the straw with an utter disregard of Mrs.
			Hall&rsquo;s carpet. And from it he began to produce bottles&mdash;little fat
			bottles containing powders, small and slender bottles containing coloured and
			white fluids, fluted blue bottles labeled Poison, bottles with round bodies and
			slender necks, large green-glass bottles, large white-glass bottles, bottles
			with glass stoppers and frosted labels, bottles with fine corks, bottles with
			bungs, bottles with wooden caps, wine bottles, salad-oil bottles&mdash;putting
			them in rows on the chiffonnier, on the mantel, on the table under the window,
			round the floor, on the bookshelf&mdash;everywhere. The chemist&rsquo;s shop in
			Bramblehurst could not boast half so many. Quite a sight it was. Crate after
			crate yielded bottles, until all six were empty and the table high with straw;
			the only things that came out of these crates besides the bottles were a number
			of test-tubes and a carefully packed balance.
		</p>

		<p>
			And directly the crates were unpacked, the stranger went to the window and set
			to work, not troubling in the least about the litter of straw, the fire which
			had gone out, the box of books outside, nor for the trunks and other luggage
			that had gone upstairs.
		</p>

		<p>
			When Mrs. Hall took his dinner in to him, he was already so absorbed in his
			work, pouring little drops out of the bottles into test-tubes, that he did not
			hear her until she had swept away the bulk of the straw and put the tray on the
			table, with some little emphasis perhaps, seeing the state that the floor was
			in. Then he half turned his head and immediately turned it away again. But she
			saw he had removed his glasses; they were beside him on the table, and it
			seemed to her that his eye sockets were extraordinarily hollow. He put on his
			spectacles again, and then turned and faced her. She was about to complain of
			the straw on the floor when he anticipated her.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t come in without knocking,&rdquo; he said in
			the tone of abnormal exasperation that seemed so characteristic of him.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I knocked, but seemingly&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Perhaps you did. But in my investigations&mdash;my really very urgent
			and necessary investigations&mdash;the slightest disturbance, the jar of a
			door&mdash;I must ask you&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Certainly, sir. You can turn the lock if you&rsquo;re like that, you
			know. Any time.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;A very good idea,&rdquo; said the stranger.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;This stror, sir, if I might make so bold as to remark&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. If the straw makes trouble put it down in the bill.&rdquo;
			And he mumbled at her&mdash;words suspiciously like curses.
		</p>

		<p>
			He was so odd, standing there, so aggressive and explosive, bottle in one hand
			and test-tube in the other, that Mrs. Hall was quite alarmed. But she was a
			resolute woman. &ldquo;In which case, I should like to know, sir, what you
			consider&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;A shilling&mdash;put down a shilling. Surely a shilling&rsquo;s
			enough?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hall, taking up the table-cloth and beginning
			to spread it over the table. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re satisfied, of
			course&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He turned and sat down, with his coat-collar toward her.
		</p>

		<p>
			All the afternoon he worked with the door locked and, as Mrs. Hall testifies,
			for the most part in silence. But once there was a concussion and a sound of
			bottles ringing together as though the table had been hit, and the smash of a
			bottle flung violently down, and then a rapid pacing athwart the room. Fearing
			&ldquo;something was the matter,&rdquo; she went to the door and listened, not
			caring to knock.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go on,&rdquo; he was raving. &ldquo;I <i>can&rsquo;t</i>
			go on. Three hundred thousand, four hundred thousand! The huge multitude!
			Cheated! All my life it may take me! ... Patience! Patience indeed! ... Fool!
			fool!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			There was a noise of hobnails on the bricks in the bar, and Mrs. Hall had very
			reluctantly to leave the rest of his soliloquy. When she returned the room was
			silent again, save for the faint crepitation of his chair and the occasional
			clink of a bottle. It was all over; the stranger had resumed work.
		</p>

		<p>
			When she took in his tea she saw broken glass in the corner of the room under
			the concave mirror, and a golden stain that had been carelessly wiped. She
			called attention to it.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Put it down in the bill,&rdquo; snapped her visitor. &ldquo;For
			God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t worry me. If there&rsquo;s damage done, put it
			down in the bill,&rdquo; and he went on ticking a list in the exercise book
			before him.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you something,&rdquo; said Fearenside, mysteriously. It
			was late in the afternoon, and they were in the little beer-shop of Iping
			Hanger.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Teddy Henfrey.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;This chap you&rsquo;re speaking of, what my dog bit.
			Well&mdash;he&rsquo;s black. Leastways, his legs are. I seed through the tear
			of his trousers and the tear of his glove. You&rsquo;d have expected a sort of
			pinky to show, wouldn&rsquo;t you? Well&mdash;there wasn&rsquo;t none. Just
			blackness. I tell you, he&rsquo;s as black as my hat.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;My sakes!&rdquo; said Henfrey. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rummy case
			altogether. Why, his nose is as pink as paint!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Fearenside. &ldquo;I knows that. And I
			tell &rsquo;ee what I&rsquo;m thinking. That marn&rsquo;s a piebald, Teddy.
			Black here and white there&mdash;in patches. And he&rsquo;s ashamed of it.
			He&rsquo;s a kind of half-breed, and the colour&rsquo;s come off patchy instead
			of mixing. I&rsquo;ve heard of such things before. And it&rsquo;s the common
			way with horses, as any one can see.&rdquo;

		<h2><a name="chap04"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br />
			MR. CUSS INTERVIEWS THE STRANGER</h2>

		<p>
			I have told the circumstances of the stranger&rsquo;s arrival in Iping with a
			certain fulness of detail, in order that the curious impression he created may
			be understood by the reader. But excepting two odd incidents, the circumstances
			of his stay until the extraordinary day of the club festival may be passed over
			very cursorily. There were a number of skirmishes with Mrs. Hall on matters of
			domestic discipline, but in every case until late April, when the first signs
			of penury began, he over-rode her by the easy expedient of an extra payment.
			Hall did not like him, and whenever he dared he talked of the advisability of
			getting rid of him; but he showed his dislike chiefly by concealing it
			ostentatiously, and avoiding his visitor as much as possible. &ldquo;Wait till
			the summer,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hall sagely, &ldquo;when the artisks are beginning
			to come. Then we&rsquo;ll see. He may be a bit overbearing, but bills settled
			punctual is bills settled punctual, whatever you&rsquo;d like to say.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			The stranger did not go to church, and indeed made no difference between Sunday
			and the irreligious days, even in costume. He worked, as Mrs. Hall thought,
			very fitfully. Some days he would come down early and be continuously busy. On
			others he would rise late, pace his room, fretting audibly for hours together,
			smoke, sleep in the armchair by the fire. Communication with the world beyond
			the village he had none. His temper continued very uncertain; for the most part
			his manner was that of a man suffering under almost unendurable provocation,
			and once or twice things were snapped, torn, crushed, or broken in spasmodic
			gusts of violence. He seemed under a chronic irritation of the greatest
			intensity. His habit of talking to himself in a low voice grew steadily upon
			him, but though Mrs. Hall listened conscientiously she could make neither head
			nor tail of what she heard.
		</p>

		<p>
			He rarely went abroad by daylight, but at twilight he would go out muffled up
			invisibly, whether the weather were cold or not, and he chose the loneliest
			paths and those most overshadowed by trees and banks. His goggling spectacles
			and ghastly bandaged face under the penthouse of his hat, came with a
			disagreeable suddenness out of the darkness upon one or two home-going
			labourers, and Teddy Henfrey, tumbling out of the &ldquo;Scarlet Coat&rdquo;
			one night, at half-past nine, was scared shamefully by the stranger&rsquo;s
			skull-like head (he was walking hat in hand) lit by the sudden light of the
			opened inn door. Such children as saw him at nightfall dreamt of bogies, and it
			seemed doubtful whether he disliked boys more than they disliked him, or the
			reverse; but there was certainly a vivid enough dislike on either side.
		</p>

		<p>
			It was inevitable that a person of so remarkable an appearance and bearing
			should form a frequent topic in such a village as Iping. Opinion was greatly
			divided about his occupation. Mrs. Hall was sensitive on the point. When
			questioned, she explained very carefully that he was an &ldquo;experimental
			investigator,&rdquo; going gingerly over the syllables as one who dreads
			pitfalls. When asked what an experimental investigator was, she would say with
			a touch of superiority that most educated people knew such things as that, and
			would thus explain that he &ldquo;discovered things.&rdquo; Her visitor had had
			an accident, she said, which temporarily discoloured his face and hands, and
			being of a sensitive disposition, he was averse to any public notice of the
			fact.
		</p>

		<p>
			Out of her hearing there was a view largely entertained that he was a criminal
			trying to escape from justice by wrapping himself up so as to conceal himself
			altogether from the eye of the police. This idea sprang from the brain of Mr.
			Teddy Henfrey. No crime of any magnitude dating from the middle or end of
			February was known to have occurred. Elaborated in the imagination of Mr.
			Gould, the probationary assistant in the National School, this theory took the
			form that the stranger was an Anarchist in disguise, preparing explosives, and
			he resolved to undertake such detective operations as his time permitted. These
			consisted for the most part in looking very hard at the stranger whenever they
			met, or in asking people who had never seen the stranger, leading questions
			about him. But he detected nothing.
		</p>

		<p>
			Another school of opinion followed Mr. Fearenside, and either accepted the
			piebald view or some modification of it; as, for instance, Silas Durgan, who
			was heard to assert that &ldquo;if he chooses to show enself at fairs
			he&rsquo;d make his fortune in no time,&rdquo; and being a bit of a theologian,
			compared the stranger to the man with the one talent. Yet another view
			explained the entire matter by regarding the stranger as a harmless lunatic.
			That had the advantage of accounting for everything straight away.
		</p>

		<p>
			Between these main groups there were waverers and compromisers. Sussex folk
			have few superstitions, and it was only after the events of early April that
			the thought of the supernatural was first whispered in the village. Even then
			it was only credited among the women folk.
		</p>

		<p>
			But whatever they thought of him, people in Iping, on the whole, agreed in
			disliking him. His irritability, though it might have been comprehensible to an
			urban brain-worker, was an amazing thing to these quiet Sussex villagers. The
			frantic gesticulations they surprised now and then, the headlong pace after
			nightfall that swept him upon them round quiet corners, the inhuman bludgeoning
			of all tentative advances of curiosity, the taste for twilight that led to the
			closing of doors, the pulling down of blinds, the extinction of candles and
			lamps&mdash;who could agree with such goings on? They drew aside as he passed
			down the village, and when he had gone by, young humourists would up with
			coat-collars and down with hat-brims, and go pacing nervously after him in
			imitation of his occult bearing. There was a song popular at that time called
			&ldquo;The Bogey Man&rdquo;. Miss Statchell sang it at the schoolroom concert
			(in aid of the church lamps), and thereafter whenever one or two of the
			villagers were gathered together and the stranger appeared, a bar or so of this
			tune, more or less sharp or flat, was whistled in the midst of them. Also
			belated little children would call &ldquo;Bogey Man!&rdquo; after him, and make
			off tremulously elated.
		</p>

		<p>
			Cuss, the general practitioner, was devoured by curiosity. The bandages excited
			his professional interest, the report of the thousand and one bottles aroused
			his jealous regard. All through April and May he coveted an opportunity of
			talking to the stranger, and at last, towards Whitsuntide, he could stand it no
			longer, but hit upon the subscription-list for a village nurse as an excuse. He
			was surprised to find that Mr. Hall did not know his guest&rsquo;s name.
			&ldquo;He give a name,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hall&mdash;an assertion which was quite
			unfounded&mdash;&ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t rightly hear it.&rdquo; She thought
			it seemed so silly not to know the man&rsquo;s name.
		</p>

		<p>
			Cuss rapped at the parlour door and entered. There was a fairly audible
			imprecation from within. &ldquo;Pardon my intrusion,&rdquo; said Cuss, and then
			the door closed and cut Mrs. Hall off from the rest of the conversation.
		</p>

		<p>
			She could hear the murmur of voices for the next ten minutes, then a cry of
			surprise, a stirring of feet, a chair flung aside, a bark of laughter, quick
			steps to the door, and Cuss appeared, his face white, his eyes staring over his
			shoulder. He left the door open behind him, and without looking at her strode
			across the hall and went down the steps, and she heard his feet hurrying along
			the road. He carried his hat in his hand. She stood behind the door, looking at
			the open door of the parlour. Then she heard the stranger laughing quietly, and
			then his footsteps came across the room. She could not see his face where she
			stood. The parlour door slammed, and the place was silent again.
		</p>

		<p>
			Cuss went straight up the village to Bunting the vicar. &ldquo;Am I mad?&rdquo;
			Cuss began abruptly, as he entered the shabby little study. &ldquo;Do I look
			like an insane person?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; said the vicar, putting the ammonite on
			the loose sheets of his forth-coming sermon.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;That chap at the inn&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Give me something to drink,&rdquo; said Cuss, and he sat down.
		</p>

		<p>
			When his nerves had been steadied by a glass of cheap sherry&mdash;the only
			drink the good vicar had available&mdash;he told him of the interview he had
			just had. &ldquo;Went in,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;and began to demand a
			subscription for that Nurse Fund. He&rsquo;d stuck his hands in his pockets as
			I came in, and he sat down lumpily in his chair. Sniffed. I told him I&rsquo;d
			heard he took an interest in scientific things. He said yes. Sniffed again.
			Kept on sniffing all the time; evidently recently caught an infernal cold. No
			wonder, wrapped up like that! I developed the nurse idea, and all the while
			kept my eyes open. Bottles&mdash;chemicals&mdash;everywhere. Balance,
			test-tubes in stands, and a smell of&mdash;evening primrose. Would he
			subscribe? Said he&rsquo;d consider it. Asked him, point-blank, was he
			researching. Said he was. A long research? Got quite cross. &lsquo;A damnable
			long research,&rsquo; said he, blowing the cork out, so to speak.
			&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said I. And out came the grievance. The man was just on the
			boil, and my question boiled him over. He had been given a prescription, most
			valuable prescription&mdash;what for he wouldn&rsquo;t say. Was it medical?
			&lsquo;Damn you! What are you fishing after?&rsquo; I apologised. Dignified
			sniff and cough. He resumed. He&rsquo;d read it. Five ingredients. Put it down;
			turned his head. Draught of air from window lifted the paper. Swish, rustle. He
			was working in a room with an open fireplace, he said. Saw a flicker, and there
			was the prescription burning and lifting chimneyward. Rushed towards it just as
			it whisked up the chimney. So! Just at that point, to illustrate his story, out
			came his arm.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;No hand&mdash;just an empty sleeve. Lord! I thought, <i>that&rsquo;s</i>
			a deformity! Got a cork arm, I suppose, and has taken it off. Then, I thought,
			there&rsquo;s something odd in that. What the devil keeps that sleeve up and
			open, if there&rsquo;s nothing in it? There was nothing in it, I tell you.
			Nothing down it, right down to the joint. I could see right down it to the
			elbow, and there was a glimmer of light shining through a tear of the cloth.
			&lsquo;Good God!&rsquo; I said. Then he stopped. Stared at me with those black
			goggles of his, and then at his sleeve.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all. He never said a word; just glared, and put his sleeve
			back in his pocket quickly. &lsquo;I was saying,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that
			there was the prescription burning, wasn&rsquo;t I?&rsquo; Interrogative cough.
			&lsquo;How the devil,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;can you move an empty sleeve like
			that?&rsquo; &lsquo;Empty sleeve?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;an
			empty sleeve.&rsquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s an empty sleeve, is it? You saw it was an empty
			sleeve?&rsquo; He stood up right away. I stood up too. He came towards me in
			three very slow steps, and stood quite close. Sniffed venomously. I
			didn&rsquo;t flinch, though I&rsquo;m hanged if that bandaged knob of his, and
			those blinkers, aren&rsquo;t enough to unnerve any one, coming quietly up to
			you.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;&lsquo;You said it was an empty sleeve?&rsquo; he said.
			&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; I said. At staring and saying nothing a barefaced man,
			unspectacled, starts scratch. Then very quietly he pulled his sleeve out of his
			pocket again, and raised his arm towards me as though he would show it to me
			again. He did it very, very slowly. I looked at it. Seemed an age.
			&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said I, clearing my throat, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s nothing in
			it.&rsquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Had to say something. I was beginning to feel frightened. I could see
			right down it. He extended it straight towards me, slowly, slowly&mdash;just
			like that&mdash;until the cuff was six inches from my face. Queer thing to see
			an empty sleeve come at you like that! And then&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Something&mdash;exactly like a finger and thumb it felt&mdash;nipped my
			nose.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Bunting began to laugh.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t anything there!&rdquo; said Cuss, his voice running
			up into a shriek at the &ldquo;there.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well
			for you to laugh, but I tell you I was so startled, I hit his cuff hard, and
			turned around, and cut out of the room&mdash;I left him&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Cuss stopped. There was no mistaking the sincerity of his panic. He turned
			round in a helpless way and took a second glass of the excellent vicar&rsquo;s
			very inferior sherry. &ldquo;When I hit his cuff,&rdquo; said Cuss, &ldquo;I
			tell you, it felt exactly like hitting an arm. And there wasn&rsquo;t an arm!
			There wasn&rsquo;t the ghost of an arm!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Mr. Bunting thought it over. He looked suspiciously at Cuss. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
			a most remarkable story,&rdquo; he said. He looked very wise and grave indeed.
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really,&rdquo; said Mr. Bunting with judicial emphasis,
			&ldquo;a most remarkable story.&rdquo;

			THE BURGLARY AT THE VICARAGE</h2>

		<p>
			The facts of the burglary at the vicarage came to us chiefly through the medium
			of the vicar and his wife. It occurred in the small hours of Whit Monday, the
			day devoted in Iping to the Club festivities. Mrs. Bunting, it seems, woke up
			suddenly in the stillness that comes before the dawn, with the strong
			impression that the door of their bedroom had opened and closed. She did not
			arouse her husband at first, but sat up in bed listening. She then distinctly
			heard the pad, pad, pad of bare feet coming out of the adjoining dressing-room
			and walking along the passage towards the staircase. As soon as she felt
			assured of this, she aroused the Rev. Mr. Bunting as quietly as possible. He
			did not strike a light, but putting on his spectacles, her dressing-gown and
			his bath slippers, he went out on the landing to listen. He heard quite
			distinctly a fumbling going on at his study desk down-stairs, and then a
			violent sneeze.
		</p>

		<p>
			At that he returned to his bedroom, armed himself with the most obvious weapon,
			the poker, and descended the staircase as noiselessly as possible. Mrs. Bunting
			came out on the landing.
		</p>

		<p>
			The hour was about four, and the ultimate darkness of the night was past. There
			was a faint shimmer of light in the hall, but the study doorway yawned
			impenetrably black. Everything was still except the faint creaking of the
			stairs under Mr. Bunting&rsquo;s tread, and the slight movements in the study.
			Then something snapped, the drawer was opened, and there was a rustle of
			papers. Then came an imprecation, and a match was struck and the study was
			flooded with yellow light. Mr. Bunting was now in the hall, and through the
			crack of the door he could see the desk and the open drawer and a candle
			burning on the desk. But the robber he could not see. He stood there in the
			hall undecided what to do, and Mrs. Bunting, her face white and intent, crept
			slowly downstairs after him. One thing kept Mr. Bunting&rsquo;s courage; the
			persuasion that this burglar was a resident in the village.
		</p>

		<p>
			They heard the chink of money, and realised that the robber had found the
			housekeeping reserve of gold&mdash;two pounds ten in half sovereigns
			altogether. At that sound Mr. Bunting was nerved to abrupt action. Gripping the
			poker firmly, he rushed into the room, closely followed by Mrs. Bunting.
			&ldquo;Surrender!&rdquo; cried Mr. Bunting, fiercely, and then stooped amazed.
			Apparently the room was perfectly empty.
		</p>

		<p>
			Yet their conviction that they had, that very moment, heard somebody moving in
			the room had amounted to a certainty. For half a minute, perhaps, they stood
			gaping, then Mrs. Bunting went across the room and looked behind the screen,
			while Mr. Bunting, by a kindred impulse, peered under the desk. Then Mrs.
			Bunting turned back the window-curtains, and Mr. Bunting looked up the chimney
			and probed it with the poker. Then Mrs. Bunting scrutinised the waste-paper
			basket and Mr. Bunting opened the lid of the coal-scuttle. Then they came to a
			stop and stood with eyes interrogating each other.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I could have sworn&mdash;&rdquo; said Mr. Bunting.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;The candle!&rdquo; said Mr. Bunting. &ldquo;Who lit the candle?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;The drawer!&rdquo; said Mrs. Bunting. &ldquo;And the money&rsquo;s
			gone!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			She went hastily to the doorway.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Of all the strange occurrences&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			There was a violent sneeze in the passage. They rushed out, and as they did so
			the kitchen door slammed. &ldquo;Bring the candle,&rdquo; said Mr. Bunting, and
			led the way. They both heard a sound of bolts being hastily shot back.
		</p>

		<p>
			As he opened the kitchen door he saw through the scullery that the back door
			was just opening, and the faint light of early dawn displayed the dark masses
			of the garden beyond. He is certain that nothing went out of the door. It
			opened, stood open for a moment, and then closed with a slam. As it did so, the
			candle Mrs. Bunting was carrying from the study flickered and flared. It was a
			minute or more before they entered the kitchen.
		</p>

		<p>
			The place was empty. They refastened the back door, examined the kitchen,
			pantry, and scullery thoroughly, and at last went down into the cellar. There
			was not a soul to be found in the house, search as they would.
		</p>

		<p>
			Daylight found the vicar and his wife, a quaintly-costumed little couple, still
			marvelling about on their own ground floor by the unnecessary light of a
			guttering candle.

		<h2><a name="chap06"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br />
			THE FURNITURE THAT WENT MAD</h2>

		<p>
			Now it happened that in the early hours of Whit Monday, before Millie was
			hunted out for the day, Mr. Hall and Mrs. Hall both rose and went noiselessly
			down into the cellar. Their business there was of a private nature, and had
			something to do with the specific gravity of their beer. They had hardly
			entered the cellar when Mrs. Hall found she had forgotten to bring down a
			bottle of sarsaparilla from their joint-room. As she was the expert and
			principal operator in this affair, Hall very properly went upstairs for it.
		</p>

		<p>
			On the landing he was surprised to see that the stranger&rsquo;s door was ajar.
			He went on into his own room and found the bottle as he had been directed.
		</p>

		<p>
			But returning with the bottle, he noticed that the bolts of the front door had
			been shot back, that the door was in fact simply on the latch. And with a flash
			of inspiration he connected this with the stranger&rsquo;s room upstairs and
			the suggestions of Mr. Teddy Henfrey. He distinctly remembered holding the
			candle while Mrs. Hall shot these bolts overnight. At the sight he stopped,
			gaping, then with the bottle still in his hand went upstairs again. He rapped
			at the stranger&rsquo;s door. There was no answer. He rapped again; then pushed
			the door wide open and entered.
		</p>

		<p>
			It was as he expected. The bed, the room also, was empty. And what was
			stranger, even to his heavy intelligence, on the bedroom chair and along the
			rail of the bed were scattered the garments, the only garments so far as he
			knew, and the bandages of their guest. His big slouch hat even was cocked
			jauntily over the bed-post.
		</p>

		<p>
			As Hall stood there he heard his wife&rsquo;s voice coming out of the depth of
			the cellar, with that rapid telescoping of the syllables and interrogative
			cocking up of the final words to a high note, by which the West Sussex villager
			is wont to indicate a brisk impatience. &ldquo;George! You gart whad a
			wand?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			At that he turned and hurried down to her. &ldquo;Janny,&rdquo; he said, over
			the rail of the cellar steps, &ldquo;&rsquo;tas the truth what Henfrey sez.
			&rsquo;E&rsquo;s not in uz room, &rsquo;e en&rsquo;t. And the front
			door&rsquo;s onbolted.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			At first Mrs. Hall did not understand, and as soon as she did she resolved to
			see the empty room for herself. Hall, still holding the bottle, went first.
			&ldquo;If &rsquo;e en&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;&rsquo;is close
			are. And what&rsquo;s &rsquo;e doin&rsquo; &rsquo;ithout &rsquo;is close, then?
			&rsquo;Tas a most curious business.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			As they came up the cellar steps they both, it was afterwards ascertained,
			fancied they heard the front door open and shut, but seeing it closed and
			nothing there, neither said a word to the other about it at the time. Mrs. Hall
			passed her husband in the passage and ran on first upstairs. Someone sneezed on
			the staircase. Hall, following six steps behind, thought that he heard her
			sneeze. She, going on first, was under the impression that Hall was sneezing.
			She flung open the door and stood regarding the room. &ldquo;Of all the
			curious!&rdquo; she said.
		</p>

		<p>
			She heard a sniff close behind her head as it seemed, and turning, was
			surprised to see Hall a dozen feet off on the topmost stair. But in another
			moment he was beside her. She bent forward and put her hand on the pillow and
			then under the clothes.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Cold,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been up this hour or
			more.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			As she did so, a most extraordinary thing happened. The bed-clothes gathered
			themselves together, leapt up suddenly into a sort of peak, and then jumped
			headlong over the bottom rail. It was exactly as if a hand had clutched them in
			the centre and flung them aside. Immediately after, the stranger&rsquo;s hat
			hopped off the bed-post, described a whirling flight in the air through the
			better part of a circle, and then dashed straight at Mrs. Hall&rsquo;s face.
			Then as swiftly came the sponge from the washstand; and then the chair,
			flinging the stranger&rsquo;s coat and trousers carelessly aside, and laughing
			drily in a voice singularly like the stranger&rsquo;s, turned itself up with
			its four legs at Mrs. Hall, seemed to take aim at her for a moment, and charged
			at her. She screamed and turned, and then the chair legs came gently but firmly
			against her back and impelled her and Hall out of the room. The door slammed
			violently and was locked. The chair and bed seemed to be executing a dance of
			triumph for a moment, and then abruptly everything was still.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mrs. Hall was left almost in a fainting condition in Mr. Hall&rsquo;s arms on
			the landing. It was with the greatest difficulty that Mr. Hall and Millie, who
			had been roused by her scream of alarm, succeeded in getting her downstairs,
			and applying the restoratives customary in such cases.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;&rsquo;Tas sperits,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hall. &ldquo;I know &rsquo;tas
			sperits. I&rsquo;ve read in papers of en. Tables and chairs leaping and
			dancing...&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Take a drop more, Janny,&rdquo; said Hall. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twill steady
			ye.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Lock him out,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hall. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him come in
			again. I half guessed&mdash;I might ha&rsquo; known. With them goggling eyes
			and bandaged head, and never going to church of a Sunday. And all they
			bottles&mdash;more&rsquo;n it&rsquo;s right for any one to have. He&rsquo;s put
			the sperits into the furniture.... My good old furniture! &rsquo;Twas in that
			very chair my poor dear mother used to sit when I was a little girl. To think
			it should rise up against me now!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Just a drop more, Janny,&rdquo; said Hall. &ldquo;Your nerves is all
			upset.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			They sent Millie across the street through the golden five o&rsquo;clock
			sunshine to rouse up Mr. Sandy Wadgers, the blacksmith. Mr. Hall&rsquo;s
			compliments and the furniture upstairs was behaving most extraordinary. Would
			Mr. Wadgers come round? He was a knowing man, was Mr. Wadgers, and very
			resourceful. He took quite a grave view of the case. &ldquo;Arm darmed if thet
			ent witchcraft,&rdquo; was the view of Mr. Sandy Wadgers. &ldquo;You warnt
			horseshoes for such gentry as he.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He came round greatly concerned. They wanted him to lead the way upstairs to
			the room, but he didn&rsquo;t seem to be in any hurry. He preferred to talk in
			the passage. Over the way Huxter&rsquo;s apprentice came out and began taking
			down the shutters of the tobacco window. He was called over to join the
			discussion. Mr. Huxter naturally followed over in the course of a few minutes.
			The Anglo-Saxon genius for parliamentary government asserted itself; there was
			a great deal of talk and no decisive action. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have the facts
			first,&rdquo; insisted Mr. Sandy Wadgers. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be sure we&rsquo;d
			be acting perfectly right in bustin&rsquo; that there door open. A door onbust
			is always open to bustin&rsquo;, but ye can&rsquo;t onbust a door once
			you&rsquo;ve busted en.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			And suddenly and most wonderfully the door of the room upstairs opened of its
			own accord, and as they looked up in amazement, they saw descending the stairs
			the muffled figure of the stranger staring more blackly and blankly than ever
			with those unreasonably large blue glass eyes of his. He came down stiffly and
			slowly, staring all the time; he walked across the passage staring, then
			stopped.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Look there!&rdquo; he said, and their eyes followed the direction of his
			gloved finger and saw a bottle of sarsaparilla hard by the cellar door. Then he
			entered the parlour, and suddenly, swiftly, viciously, slammed the door in
			their faces.
		</p>

		<p>
			Not a word was spoken until the last echoes of the slam had died away. They
			stared at one another. &ldquo;Well, if that don&rsquo;t lick everything!&rdquo;
			said Mr. Wadgers, and left the alternative unsaid.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;d go in and ask&rsquo;n &rsquo;bout it,&rdquo; said Wadgers, to
			Mr. Hall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d d&rsquo;mand an explanation.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			It took some time to bring the landlady&rsquo;s husband up to that pitch. At
			last he rapped, opened the door, and got as far as, &ldquo;Excuse
			me&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Go to the devil!&rdquo; said the stranger in a tremendous voice, and
			&ldquo;Shut that door after you.&rdquo; So that brief interview terminated.
		</p>

	<div class="chapter">

		<h2><a name="chap07"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br />
			THE UNVEILING OF THE STRANGER</h2>

		<p>
			The stranger went into the little parlour of the &ldquo;Coach and Horses&rdquo;
			about half-past five in the morning, and there he remained until near midday,
			the blinds down, the door shut, and none, after Hall&rsquo;s repulse, venturing
			near him.
		</p>

		<p>
			All that time he must have fasted. Thrice he rang his bell, the third time
			furiously and continuously, but no one answered him. &ldquo;Him and his
			&lsquo;go to the devil&rsquo; indeed!&rdquo; said Mrs. Hall. Presently came an
			imperfect rumour of the burglary at the vicarage, and two and two were put
			together. Hall, assisted by Wadgers, went off to find Mr. Shuckleforth, the
			magistrate, and take his advice. No one ventured upstairs. How the stranger
			occupied himself is unknown. Now and then he would stride violently up and
			down, and twice came an outburst of curses, a tearing of paper, and a violent
			smashing of bottles.
		</p>

		<p>
			The little group of scared but curious people increased. Mrs. Huxter came over;
			some gay young fellows resplendent in black ready-made jackets and
			<i>piqu&eacute;</i> paper ties&mdash;for it was Whit Monday&mdash;joined the
			group with confused interrogations. Young Archie Harker distinguished himself
			by going up the yard and trying to peep under the window-blinds. He could see
			nothing, but gave reason for supposing that he did, and others of the Iping
			youth presently joined him.
		</p>

		<p>
			It was the finest of all possible Whit Mondays, and down the village street
			stood a row of nearly a dozen booths, a shooting gallery, and on the grass by
			the forge were three yellow and chocolate waggons and some picturesque
			strangers of both sexes putting up a cocoanut shy. The gentlemen wore blue
			jerseys, the ladies white aprons and quite fashionable hats with heavy plumes.
			Wodger, of the &ldquo;Purple Fawn,&rdquo; and Mr. Jaggers, the cobbler, who
			also sold old second-hand ordinary bicycles, were stretching a string of
			union-jacks and royal ensigns (which had originally celebrated the first
			Victorian Jubilee) across the road.
		</p>

		<p>
			And inside, in the artificial darkness of the parlour, into which only one thin
			jet of sunlight penetrated, the stranger, hungry we must suppose, and fearful,
			hidden in his uncomfortable hot wrappings, pored through his dark glasses upon
			his paper or chinked his dirty little bottles, and occasionally swore savagely
			at the boys, audible if invisible, outside the windows. In the corner by the
			fireplace lay the fragments of half a dozen smashed bottles, and a pungent
			twang of chlorine tainted the air. So much we know from what was heard at the
			time and from what was subsequently seen in the room.
		</p>

		<p>
			About noon he suddenly opened his parlour door and stood glaring fixedly at the
			three or four people in the bar. &ldquo;Mrs. Hall,&rdquo; he said. Somebody
			went sheepishly and called for Mrs. Hall.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mrs. Hall appeared after an interval, a little short of breath, but all the
			fiercer for that. Hall was still out. She had deliberated over this scene, and
			she came holding a little tray with an unsettled bill upon it. &ldquo;Is it
			your bill you&rsquo;re wanting, sir?&rdquo; she said.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Why wasn&rsquo;t my breakfast laid? Why haven&rsquo;t you prepared my
			meals and answered my bell? Do you think I live without eating?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t my bill paid?&rdquo; said Mrs. Hall. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
			what I want to know.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I told you three days ago I was awaiting a remittance&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I told you two days ago I wasn&rsquo;t going to await no remittances.
			You can&rsquo;t grumble if your breakfast waits a bit, if my bill&rsquo;s been
			waiting these five days, can you?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			The stranger swore briefly but vividly.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Nar, nar!&rdquo; from the bar.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d thank you kindly, sir, if you&rsquo;d keep your swearing
			to yourself, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hall.
		</p>

		<p>
			The stranger stood looking more like an angry diving-helmet than ever. It was
			universally felt in the bar that Mrs. Hall had the better of him. His next
			words showed as much.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Look here, my good woman&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &lsquo;good woman&rsquo; <i>me</i>,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hall.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you my remittance hasn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Remittance indeed!&rdquo; said Mrs. Hall.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Still, I daresay in my pocket&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You told me three days ago that you hadn&rsquo;t anything but a
			sovereign&rsquo;s worth of silver upon you.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve found some more&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;&rsquo;Ul-lo!&rdquo; from the bar.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I wonder where you found it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hall.
		</p>

		<p>
			That seemed to annoy the stranger very much. He stamped his foot. &ldquo;What
			do you mean?&rdquo; he said.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;That I wonder where you found it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hall. &ldquo;And
			before I take any bills or get any breakfasts, or do any such things
			whatsoever, you got to tell me one or two things I don&rsquo;t understand, and
			what nobody don&rsquo;t understand, and what everybody is very anxious to
			understand. I want to know what you been doing t&rsquo;my chair upstairs, and I
			want to know how &rsquo;tis your room was empty, and how you got in again. Them
			as stops in this house comes in by the doors&mdash;that&rsquo;s the rule of the
			house, and that you <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> do, and what I want to know is how you
			<i>did</i> come in. And I want to know&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Suddenly the stranger raised his gloved hands clenched, stamped his foot, and
			said, &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; with such extraordinary violence that he silenced her
			instantly.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who I am or what I
			am. I&rsquo;ll show you. By Heaven! I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo; Then he put his
			open palm over his face and withdrew it. The centre of his face became a black
			cavity. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said. He stepped forward and handed Mrs. Hall
			something which she, staring at his metamorphosed face, accepted automatically.
			Then, when she saw what it was, she screamed loudly, dropped it, and staggered
			back. The nose&mdash;it was the stranger&rsquo;s nose! pink and
			shining&mdash;rolled on the floor.
		</p>

		<p>
			Then he removed his spectacles, and everyone in the bar gasped. He took off his
			hat, and with a violent gesture tore at his whiskers and bandages. For a moment
			they resisted him. A flash of horrible anticipation passed through the bar.
			&ldquo;Oh, my Gard!&rdquo; said some one. Then off they came.
		</p>

		<p>
			It was worse than anything. Mrs. Hall, standing open-mouthed and horror-struck,
			shrieked at what she saw, and made for the door of the house. Everyone began to
			move. They were prepared for scars, disfigurements, tangible horrors, but
			nothing! The bandages and false hair flew across the passage into the bar,
			making a hobbledehoy jump to avoid them. Everyone tumbled on everyone else down
			the steps. For the man who stood there shouting some incoherent explanation,
			was a solid gesticulating figure up to the coat-collar of him, and
			then&mdash;nothingness, no visible thing at all!
		</p>

		<p>
			People down the village heard shouts and shrieks, and looking up the street saw
			the &ldquo;Coach and Horses&rdquo; violently firing out its humanity. They saw
			Mrs. Hall fall down and Mr. Teddy Henfrey jump to avoid tumbling over her, and
			then they heard the frightful screams of Millie, who, emerging suddenly from
			the kitchen at the noise of the tumult, had come upon the headless stranger
			from behind. These increased suddenly.
		</p>

		<p>
			Forthwith everyone all down the street, the sweetstuff seller, cocoanut shy
			proprietor and his assistant, the swing man, little boys and girls, rustic
			dandies, smart wenches, smocked elders and aproned gipsies&mdash;began running
			towards the inn, and in a miraculously short space of time a crowd of perhaps
			forty people, and rapidly increasing, swayed and hooted and inquired and
			exclaimed and suggested, in front of Mrs. Hall&rsquo;s establishment. Everyone
			seemed eager to talk at once, and the result was Babel. A small group supported
			Mrs. Hall, who was picked up in a state of collapse. There was a conference,
			and the incredible evidence of a vociferous eye-witness. &ldquo;O Bogey!&rdquo;
			&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he been doin&rsquo;, then?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t hurt
			the girl, &rsquo;as &rsquo;e?&rdquo; &ldquo;Run at en with a knife, I
			believe.&rdquo; &ldquo;No &rsquo;ed, I tell ye. I don&rsquo;t mean no manner of
			speaking. I mean <i>marn &rsquo;ithout a &rsquo;ed</i>!&rdquo;
			&ldquo;Narnsense! &rsquo;tis some conjuring trick.&rdquo; &ldquo;Fetched off
			&rsquo;is wrapping, &rsquo;e did&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			In its struggles to see in through the open door, the crowd formed itself into
			a straggling wedge, with the more adventurous apex nearest the inn. &ldquo;He
			stood for a moment, I heerd the gal scream, and he turned. I saw her skirts
			whisk, and he went after her. Didn&rsquo;t take ten seconds. Back he comes with
			a knife in uz hand and a loaf; stood just as if he was staring. Not a moment
			ago. Went in that there door. I tell &rsquo;e, &rsquo;e ain&rsquo;t gart no
			&rsquo;ed at all. You just missed en&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			There was a disturbance behind, and the speaker stopped to step aside for a
			little procession that was marching very resolutely towards the house; first
			Mr. Hall, very red and determined, then Mr. Bobby Jaffers, the village
			constable, and then the wary Mr. Wadgers. They had come now armed with a
			warrant.
		</p>

		<p>
			People shouted conflicting information of the recent circumstances.
			&ldquo;&rsquo;Ed or no &rsquo;ed,&rdquo; said Jaffers, &ldquo;I got to
			&rsquo;rest en, and &rsquo;rest en I <i>will</i>.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Mr. Hall marched up the steps, marched straight to the door of the parlour and
			flung it open. &ldquo;Constable,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do your duty.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Jaffers marched in. Hall next, Wadgers last. They saw in the dim light the
			headless figure facing them, with a gnawed crust of bread in one gloved hand
			and a chunk of cheese in the other.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him!&rdquo; said Hall.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What the devil&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; came in a tone of angry
			expostulation from above the collar of the figure.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a damned rum customer, mister,&rdquo; said Mr. Jaffers.
			&ldquo;But &rsquo;ed or no &rsquo;ed, the warrant says &lsquo;body,&rsquo; and
			duty&rsquo;s duty&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Keep off!&rdquo; said the figure, starting back.
		</p>

		<p>
			Abruptly he whipped down the bread and cheese, and Mr. Hall just grasped the
			knife on the table in time to save it. Off came the stranger&rsquo;s left glove
			and was slapped in Jaffers&rsquo; face. In another moment Jaffers, cutting
			short some statement concerning a warrant, had gripped him by the handless
			wrist and caught his invisible throat. He got a sounding kick on the shin that
			made him shout, but he kept his grip. Hall sent the knife sliding along the
			table to Wadgers, who acted as goal-keeper for the offensive, so to speak, and
			then stepped forward as Jaffers and the stranger swayed and staggered towards
			him, clutching and hitting in. A chair stood in the way, and went aside with a
			crash as they came down together.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Get the feet,&rdquo; said Jaffers between his teeth.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mr. Hall, endeavouring to act on instructions, received a sounding kick in the
			ribs that disposed of him for a moment, and Mr. Wadgers, seeing the decapitated
			stranger had rolled over and got the upper side of Jaffers, retreated towards
			the door, knife in hand, and so collided with Mr. Huxter and the Sidderbridge
			carter coming to the rescue of law and order. At the same moment down came
			three or four bottles from the chiffonnier and shot a web of pungency into the
			air of the room.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll surrender,&rdquo; cried the stranger, though he had Jaffers
			down, and in another moment he stood up panting, a strange figure, headless and
			handless&mdash;for he had pulled off his right glove now as well as his left.
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good,&rdquo; he said, as if sobbing for breath.
		</p>

		<p>
			It was the strangest thing in the world to hear that voice coming as if out of
			empty space, but the Sussex peasants are perhaps the most matter-of-fact people
			under the sun. Jaffers got up also and produced a pair of handcuffs. Then he
			stared.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I say!&rdquo; said Jaffers, brought up short by a dim realization of the
			incongruity of the whole business, &ldquo;Darn it! Can&rsquo;t use &rsquo;em as
			I can see.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			The stranger ran his arm down his waistcoat, and as if by a miracle the buttons
			to which his empty sleeve pointed became undone. Then he said something about
			his shin, and stooped down. He seemed to be fumbling with his shoes and socks.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; said Huxter, suddenly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not a man at all.
			It&rsquo;s just empty clothes. Look! You can see down his collar and the
			linings of his clothes. I could put my arm&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He extended his hand; it seemed to meet something in mid-air, and he drew it
			back with a sharp exclamation. &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d keep your fingers out
			of my eye,&rdquo; said the aerial voice, in a tone of savage expostulation.
			&ldquo;The fact is, I&rsquo;m all here&mdash;head, hands, legs, and all the
			rest of it, but it happens I&rsquo;m invisible. It&rsquo;s a confounded
			nuisance, but I am. That&rsquo;s no reason why I should be poked to pieces by
			every stupid bumpkin in Iping, is it?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			The suit of clothes, now all unbuttoned and hanging loosely upon its unseen
			supports, stood up, arms akimbo.
		</p>

		<p>
			Several other of the men folks had now entered the room, so that it was closely
			crowded. &ldquo;Invisible, eh?&rdquo; said Huxter, ignoring the
			stranger&rsquo;s abuse. &ldquo;Who ever heard the likes of that?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange, perhaps, but it&rsquo;s not a crime. Why am I
			assaulted by a policeman in this fashion?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s a different matter,&rdquo; said Jaffers. &ldquo;No
			doubt you are a bit difficult to see in this light, but I got a warrant and
			it&rsquo;s all correct. What I&rsquo;m after ain&rsquo;t no
			invisibility,&mdash;it&rsquo;s burglary. There&rsquo;s a house been broke into
			and money took.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;And circumstances certainly point&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense!&rdquo; said the Invisible Man.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I hope so, sir; but I&rsquo;ve got my instructions.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come. I&rsquo;ll
			<i>come</i>. But no handcuffs.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the regular thing,&rdquo; said Jaffers.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;No handcuffs,&rdquo; stipulated the stranger.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said Jaffers.
		</p>

		<p>
			Abruptly the figure sat down, and before any one could realise was was being
			done, the slippers, socks, and trousers had been kicked off under the table.
			Then he sprang up again and flung off his coat.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Here, stop that,&rdquo; said Jaffers, suddenly realising what was
			happening. He gripped at the waistcoat; it struggled, and the shirt slipped out
			of it and left it limp and empty in his hand. &ldquo;Hold him!&rdquo; said
			Jaffers, loudly. &ldquo;Once he gets the things off&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Hold him!&rdquo; cried everyone, and there was a rush at the fluttering
			white shirt which was now all that was visible of the stranger.
		</p>

		<p>
			The shirt-sleeve planted a shrewd blow in Hall&rsquo;s face that stopped his
			open-armed advance, and sent him backward into old Toothsome the sexton, and in
			another moment the garment was lifted up and became convulsed and vacantly
			flapping about the arms, even as a shirt that is being thrust over a
			man&rsquo;s head. Jaffers clutched at it, and only helped to pull it off; he
			was struck in the mouth out of the air, and incontinently threw his truncheon
			and smote Teddy Henfrey savagely upon the crown of his head.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; said everybody, fencing at random and hitting at
			nothing. &ldquo;Hold him! Shut the door! Don&rsquo;t let him loose! I got
			something! Here he is!&rdquo; A perfect Babel of noises they made. Everybody,
			it seemed, was being hit all at once, and Sandy Wadgers, knowing as ever and
			his wits sharpened by a frightful blow in the nose, reopened the door and led
			the rout. The others, following incontinently, were jammed for a moment in the
			corner by the doorway. The hitting continued. Phipps, the Unitarian, had a
			front tooth broken, and Henfrey was injured in the cartilage of his ear.
			Jaffers was struck under the jaw, and, turning, caught at something that
			intervened between him and Huxter in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, and prevented
			their coming together. He felt a muscular chest, and in another moment the
			whole mass of struggling, excited men shot out into the crowded hall.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I got him!&rdquo; shouted Jaffers, choking and reeling through them all,
			and wrestling with purple face and swelling veins against his unseen enemy.
		</p>

		<p>
			Men staggered right and left as the extraordinary conflict swayed swiftly
			towards the house door, and went spinning down the half-dozen steps of the inn.
			Jaffers cried in a strangled voice&mdash;holding tight, nevertheless, and
			making play with his knee&mdash;spun around, and fell heavily undermost with
			his head on the gravel. Only then did his fingers relax.
		</p>

		<p>
			There were excited cries of &ldquo;Hold him!&rdquo; &ldquo;Invisible!&rdquo;
			and so forth, and a young fellow, a stranger in the place whose name did not
			come to light, rushed in at once, caught something, missed his hold, and fell
			over the constable&rsquo;s prostrate body. Half-way across the road a woman
			screamed as something pushed by her; a dog, kicked apparently, yelped and ran
			howling into Huxter&rsquo;s yard, and with that the transit of the Invisible
			Man was accomplished. For a space people stood amazed and gesticulating, and
			then came panic, and scattered them abroad through the village as a gust
			scatters dead leaves.
		</p>

		<p>
			But Jaffers lay quite still, face upward and knees bent, at the foot of the
			steps of the inn.

			IN TRANSIT</h2>

		<p>
			The eighth chapter is exceedingly brief, and relates that Gibbons, the amateur
			naturalist of the district, while lying out on the spacious open downs without
			a soul within a couple of miles of him, as he thought, and almost dozing, heard
			close to him the sound as of a man coughing, sneezing, and then swearing
			savagely to himself; and looking, beheld nothing. Yet the voice was
			indisputable. It continued to swear with that breadth and variety that
			distinguishes the swearing of a cultivated man. It grew to a climax, diminished
			again, and died away in the distance, going as it seemed to him in the
			direction of Adderdean. It lifted to a spasmodic sneeze and ended. Gibbons had
			heard nothing of the morning&rsquo;s occurrences, but the phenomenon was so
			striking and disturbing that his philosophical tranquillity vanished; he got up
			hastily, and hurried down the steepness of the hill towards the village, as

		<h2><a name="chap09"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br />
			MR. THOMAS MARVEL</h2>

		<p>
			You must picture Mr. Thomas Marvel as a person of copious, flexible visage, a
			nose of cylindrical protrusion, a liquorish, ample, fluctuating mouth, and a
			beard of bristling eccentricity. His figure inclined to embonpoint; his short
			limbs accentuated this inclination. He wore a furry silk hat, and the frequent
			substitution of twine and shoe-laces for buttons, apparent at critical points
			of his costume, marked a man essentially bachelor.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mr. Thomas Marvel was sitting with his feet in a ditch by the roadside over the
			down towards Adderdean, about a mile and a half out of Iping. His feet, save
			for socks of irregular open-work, were bare, his big toes were broad, and
			pricked like the ears of a watchful dog. In a leisurely manner&mdash;he did
			everything in a leisurely manner&mdash;he was contemplating trying on a pair of
			boots. They were the soundest boots he had come across for a long time, but too
			large for him; whereas the ones he had were, in dry weather, a very comfortable
			fit, but too thin-soled for damp. Mr. Thomas Marvel hated roomy shoes, but then
			he hated damp. He had never properly thought out which he hated most, and it
			was a pleasant day, and there was nothing better to do. So he put the four
			shoes in a graceful group on the turf and looked at them. And seeing them there
			among the grass and springing agrimony, it suddenly occurred to him that both
			pairs were exceedingly ugly to see. He was not at all startled by a voice
			behind him.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;They&rsquo;re boots, anyhow,&rdquo; said the Voice.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;They are&mdash;charity boots,&rdquo; said Mr. Thomas Marvel, with his
			head on one side regarding them distastefully; &ldquo;and which is the ugliest
			pair in the whole blessed universe, I&rsquo;m darned if I know!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said the Voice.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve worn worse&mdash;in fact, I&rsquo;ve worn none. But none so
			owdacious ugly&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll allow the expression. I&rsquo;ve been
			cadging boots&mdash;in particular&mdash;for days. Because I was sick of
			<i>them</i>. They&rsquo;re sound enough, of course. But a gentleman on tramp
			sees such a thundering lot of his boots. And if you&rsquo;ll believe me,
			I&rsquo;ve raised nothing in the whole blessed country, try as I would, but
			<i>them</i>. Look at &rsquo;em! And a good country for boots, too, in a general
			way. But it&rsquo;s just my promiscuous luck. I&rsquo;ve got my boots in this
			country ten years or more. And then they treat you like this.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beast of a country,&rdquo; said the Voice. &ldquo;And pigs
			for people.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Mr. Thomas Marvel. &ldquo;Lord! But them
			boots! It beats it.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He turned his head over his shoulder to the right, to look at the boots of his
			interlocutor with a view to comparisons, and lo! where the boots of his
			interlocutor should have been were neither legs nor boots. He was irradiated by
			the dawn of a great amazement. &ldquo;Where <i>are</i> yer?&rdquo; said Mr.
			Thomas Marvel over his shoulder and coming on all fours. He saw a stretch of
			empty downs with the wind swaying the remote green-pointed furze bushes.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Am I drunk?&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel. &ldquo;Have I had visions? Was I
			talking to myself? What the&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed,&rdquo; said a Voice.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;None of your ventriloquising <i>me</i>,&rdquo; said Mr. Thomas Marvel,
			rising sharply to his feet. &ldquo;Where <i>are</i> yer? Alarmed,
			indeed!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed,&rdquo; repeated the Voice.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ll</i> be alarmed in a minute, you silly fool,&rdquo; said
			Mr. Thomas Marvel. &ldquo;Where <i>are</i> yer? Lemme get my mark on yer...
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Are yer <i>buried</i>?&rdquo; said Mr. Thomas Marvel, after an interval.
		</p>

		<p>
			There was no answer. Mr. Thomas Marvel stood bootless and amazed, his jacket
			nearly thrown off.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Peewit,&rdquo; said a peewit, very remote.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Peewit, indeed!&rdquo; said Mr. Thomas Marvel. &ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t
			no time for foolery.&rdquo; The down was desolate, east and west, north and
			south; the road with its shallow ditches and white bordering stakes, ran smooth
			and empty north and south, and, save for that peewit, the blue sky was empty
			too. &ldquo;So help me,&rdquo; said Mr. Thomas Marvel, shuffling his coat on to
			his shoulders again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the drink! I might ha&rsquo;
			known.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the drink,&rdquo; said the Voice. &ldquo;You keep your
			nerves steady.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Ow!&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel, and his face grew white amidst its patches.
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the drink!&rdquo; his lips repeated noiselessly. He remained
			staring about him, rotating slowly backwards. &ldquo;I could have <i>swore</i>
			I heard a voice,&rdquo; he whispered.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Of course you did.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s there again,&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel, closing his eyes and
			clasping his hand on his brow with a tragic gesture. He was suddenly taken by
			the collar and shaken violently, and left more dazed than ever.
			&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool,&rdquo; said the Voice.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;off&mdash;my&mdash;blooming&mdash;chump,&rdquo; said Mr.
			Marvel. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good. It&rsquo;s fretting about them blarsted
			boots. I&rsquo;m off my blessed blooming chump. Or it&rsquo;s spirits.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Neither one thing nor the other,&rdquo; said the Voice.
			&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Chump,&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;One minute,&rdquo; said the Voice, penetratingly, tremulous with
			self-control.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Mr. Thomas Marvel, with a strange feeling of having
			been dug in the chest by a finger.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m just imagination? Just imagination?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What else <i>can</i> you be?&rdquo; said Mr. Thomas Marvel, rubbing the
			back of his neck.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the Voice, in a tone of relief. &ldquo;Then
			I&rsquo;m going to throw flints at you till you think differently.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But where <i>are</i> yer?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			The Voice made no answer. Whizz came a flint, apparently out of the air, and
			missed Mr. Marvel&rsquo;s shoulder by a hair&rsquo;s-breadth. Mr. Marvel,
			turning, saw a flint jerk up into the air, trace a complicated path, hang for a
			moment, and then fling at his feet with almost invisible rapidity. He was too
			amazed to dodge. Whizz it came, and ricochetted from a bare toe into the ditch.
			Mr. Thomas Marvel jumped a foot and howled aloud. Then he started to run,
			tripped over an unseen obstacle, and came head over heels into a sitting
			position.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;<i>Now</i>,&rdquo; said the Voice, as a third stone curved upward and
			hung in the air above the tramp. &ldquo;Am I imagination?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Mr. Marvel by way of reply struggled to his feet, and was immediately rolled
			over again. He lay quiet for a moment. &ldquo;If you struggle any more,&rdquo;
			said the Voice, &ldquo;I shall throw the flint at your head.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fair do,&rdquo; said Mr. Thomas Marvel, sitting up, taking
			his wounded toe in hand and fixing his eye on the third missile. &ldquo;I
			don&rsquo;t understand it. Stones flinging themselves. Stones talking. Put
			yourself down. Rot away. I&rsquo;m done.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			The third flint fell.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very simple,&rdquo; said the Voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an
			invisible man.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Tell us something I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel, gasping
			with pain. &ldquo;Where you&rsquo;ve hid&mdash;how you do it&mdash;I
			<i>don&rsquo;t</i> know. I&rsquo;m beat.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said the Voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m invisible.
			That&rsquo;s what I want you to understand.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Anyone could see that. There is no need for you to be so confounded
			impatient, mister. <i>Now</i> then. Give us a notion. How are you hid?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;m invisible. That&rsquo;s the great point. And what I want you
			to understand is this&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But whereabouts?&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Marvel.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Here! Six yards in front of you.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Oh, <i>come</i>! I ain&rsquo;t blind. You&rsquo;ll be telling me next
			you&rsquo;re just thin air. I&rsquo;m not one of your ignorant
			tramps&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Yes, I am&mdash;thin air. You&rsquo;re looking through me.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What! Ain&rsquo;t there any stuff to you. <i>Vox et</i>&mdash;what is
			it?&mdash;jabber. Is it that?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I am just a human being&mdash;solid, needing food and drink, needing
			covering too&mdash;But I&rsquo;m invisible. You see? Invisible. Simple idea.
			Invisible.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What, real like?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Yes, real.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a hand of you,&rdquo; said Marvel, &ldquo;if you
			<i>are</i> real. It won&rsquo;t be so darn out-of-the-way like,
			then&mdash;<i>Lord</i>!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how you made me
			jump!&mdash;gripping me like that!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He felt the hand that had closed round his wrist with his disengaged fingers,
			and his fingers went timorously up the arm, patted a muscular chest, and
			explored a bearded face. Marvel&rsquo;s face was astonishment.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dashed!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If this don&rsquo;t beat
			cock-fighting! Most remarkable!&mdash;And there I can see a rabbit clean
			through you, &rsquo;arf a mile away! Not a bit of you
			visible&mdash;except&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He scrutinised the apparently empty space keenly. &ldquo;You
			&rsquo;aven&rsquo;t been eatin&rsquo; bread and cheese?&rdquo; he asked,
			holding the invisible arm.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite right, and it&rsquo;s not quite assimilated into the
			system.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel. &ldquo;Sort of ghostly, though.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Of course, all this isn&rsquo;t half so wonderful as you think.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite wonderful enough for <i>my</i> modest wants,&rdquo;
			said Mr. Thomas Marvel. &ldquo;Howjer manage it! How the dooce is it
			done?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too long a story. And besides&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I tell you, the whole business fairly beats me,&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What I want to say at present is this: I need help. I have come to
			that&mdash;I came upon you suddenly. I was wandering, mad with rage, naked,
			impotent. I could have murdered. And I saw you&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;<i>Lord</i>!&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I came up behind you&mdash;hesitated&mdash;went on&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Mr. Marvel&rsquo;s expression was eloquent.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;&mdash;then stopped. &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;is an outcast
			like myself. This is the man for me.&rsquo; So I turned back and came to
			you&mdash;you. And&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;<i>Lord</i>!&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m all in a
			tizzy. May I ask&mdash;How is it? And what you may be requiring in the way of
			help?&mdash;Invisible!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I want you to help me get clothes&mdash;and shelter&mdash;and then, with
			other things. I&rsquo;ve left them long enough. If you won&rsquo;t&mdash;well!
			But you <i>will&mdash;must</i>.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too flabbergasted.
			Don&rsquo;t knock me about any more. And leave me go. I must get steady a bit.
			And you&rsquo;ve pretty near broken my toe. It&rsquo;s all so unreasonable.
			Empty downs, empty sky. Nothing visible for miles except the bosom of Nature.
			And then comes a voice. A voice out of heaven! And stones! And a
			fist&mdash;Lord!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Pull yourself together,&rdquo; said the Voice, &ldquo;for you have to do
			the job I&rsquo;ve chosen for you.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Mr. Marvel blew out his cheeks, and his eyes were round.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve chosen you,&rdquo; said the Voice. &ldquo;You are the only
			man except some of those fools down there, who knows there is such a thing as
			an invisible man. You have to be my helper. Help me&mdash;and I will do great
			things for you. An invisible man is a man of power.&rdquo; He stopped for a
			moment to sneeze violently.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But if you betray me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you fail to do as I
			direct you&mdash;&rdquo; He paused and tapped Mr. Marvel&rsquo;s shoulder
			smartly. Mr. Marvel gave a yelp of terror at the touch. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
			want to betray you,&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel, edging away from the direction of
			the fingers. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go a-thinking that, whatever you do. All I
			want to do is to help you&mdash;just tell me what I got to do. (Lord!) Whatever
			you want done, that I&rsquo;m most willing to do.&rdquo;

			MR. MARVEL&rsquo;S VISIT TO IPING</h2>

		<p>
			After the first gusty panic had spent itself Iping became argumentative.
			Scepticism suddenly reared its head&mdash;rather nervous scepticism, not at all
			assured of its back, but scepticism nevertheless. It is so much easier not to
			believe in an invisible man; and those who had actually seen him dissolve into
			air, or felt the strength of his arm, could be counted on the fingers of two
			hands. And of these witnesses Mr. Wadgers was presently missing, having retired
			impregnably behind the bolts and bars of his own house, and Jaffers was lying
			stunned in the parlour of the &ldquo;Coach and Horses.&rdquo; Great and strange
			ideas transcending experience often have less effect upon men and women than
			smaller, more tangible considerations. Iping was gay with bunting, and
			everybody was in gala dress. Whit Monday had been looked forward to for a month
			or more. By the afternoon even those who believed in the Unseen were beginning
			to resume their little amusements in a tentative fashion, on the supposition
			that he had quite gone away, and with the sceptics he was already a jest. But
			people, sceptics and believers alike, were remarkably sociable all that day.
		</p>

		<p>
			Haysman&rsquo;s meadow was gay with a tent, in which Mrs. Bunting and other
			ladies were preparing tea, while, without, the Sunday-school children ran races
			and played games under the noisy guidance of the curate and the Misses Cuss and
			Sackbut. No doubt there was a slight uneasiness in the air, but people for the
			most part had the sense to conceal whatever imaginative qualms they
			experienced. On the village green an inclined strong [rope?], down which,
			clinging the while to a pulley-swung handle, one could be hurled violently
			against a sack at the other end, came in for considerable favour among the
			adolescents, as also did the swings and the cocoanut shies. There was also
			promenading, and the steam organ attached to a small roundabout filled the air
			with a pungent flavour of oil and with equally pungent music. Members of the
			club, who had attended church in the morning, were splendid in badges of pink
			and green, and some of the gayer-minded had also adorned their bowler hats with
			brilliant-coloured favours of ribbon. Old Fletcher, whose conceptions of
			holiday-making were severe, was visible through the jasmine about his window or
			through the open door (whichever way you chose to look), poised delicately on a
			plank supported on two chairs, and whitewashing the ceiling of his front room.
		</p>

		<p>
			About four o&rsquo;clock a stranger entered the village from the direction of
			the downs. He was a short, stout person in an extraordinarily shabby top hat,
			and he appeared to be very much out of breath. His cheeks were alternately limp
			and tightly puffed. His mottled face was apprehensive, and he moved with a sort
			of reluctant alacrity. He turned the corner of the church, and directed his way
			to the &ldquo;Coach and Horses.&rdquo; Among others old Fletcher remembers
			seeing him, and indeed the old gentleman was so struck by his peculiar
			agitation that he inadvertently allowed a quantity of whitewash to run down the
			brush into the sleeve of his coat while regarding him.
		</p>

		<p>
			This stranger, to the perceptions of the proprietor of the cocoanut shy,
			appeared to be talking to himself, and Mr. Huxter remarked the same thing. He
			stopped at the foot of the &ldquo;Coach and Horses&rdquo; steps, and, according
			to Mr. Huxter, appeared to undergo a severe internal struggle before he could
			induce himself to enter the house. Finally he marched up the steps, and was
			seen by Mr. Huxter to turn to the left and open the door of the parlour. Mr.
			Huxter heard voices from within the room and from the bar apprising the man of
			his error. &ldquo;That room&rsquo;s private!&rdquo; said Hall, and the stranger
			shut the door clumsily and went into the bar.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the course of a few minutes he reappeared, wiping his lips with the back of
			his hand with an air of quiet satisfaction that somehow impressed Mr. Huxter as
			assumed. He stood looking about him for some moments, and then Mr. Huxter saw
			him walk in an oddly furtive manner towards the gates of the yard, upon which
			the parlour window opened. The stranger, after some hesitation, leant against
			one of the gate-posts, produced a short clay pipe, and prepared to fill it. His
			fingers trembled while doing so. He lit it clumsily, and folding his arms began
			to smoke in a languid attitude, an attitude which his occasional glances up the
			yard altogether belied.
		</p>

		<p>
			All this Mr. Huxter saw over the canisters of the tobacco window, and the
			singularity of the man&rsquo;s behaviour prompted him to maintain his
			observation.
		</p>

		<p>
			Presently the stranger stood up abruptly and put his pipe in his pocket. Then
			he vanished into the yard. Forthwith Mr. Huxter, conceiving he was witness of
			some petty larceny, leapt round his counter and ran out into the road to
			intercept the thief. As he did so, Mr. Marvel reappeared, his hat askew, a big
			bundle in a blue table-cloth in one hand, and three books tied
			together&mdash;as it proved afterwards with the Vicar&rsquo;s braces&mdash;in
			the other. Directly he saw Huxter he gave a sort of gasp, and turning sharply
			to the left, began to run. &ldquo;Stop, thief!&rdquo; cried Huxter, and set off
			after him. Mr. Huxter&rsquo;s sensations were vivid but brief. He saw the man
			just before him and spurting briskly for the church corner and the hill road.
			He saw the village flags and festivities beyond, and a face or so turned
			towards him. He bawled, &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; again. He had hardly gone ten
			strides before his shin was caught in some mysterious fashion, and he was no
			longer running, but flying with inconceivable rapidity through the air. He saw
			the ground suddenly close to his face. The world seemed to splash into a
			million whirling specks of light, and subsequent proceedings interested him no
			more.

		<h2><a name="chap11"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br />
			IN THE &ldquo;COACH AND HORSES&rdquo;</h2>

		<p>
			Now in order clearly to understand what had happened in the inn, it is
			necessary to go back to the moment when Mr. Marvel first came into view of Mr.
			Huxter&rsquo;s window.
		</p>

		<p>
			At that precise moment Mr. Cuss and Mr. Bunting were in the parlour. They were
			seriously investigating the strange occurrences of the morning, and were, with
			Mr. Hall&rsquo;s permission, making a thorough examination of the Invisible
			Man&rsquo;s belongings. Jaffers had partially recovered from his fall and had
			gone home in the charge of his sympathetic friends. The stranger&rsquo;s
			scattered garments had been removed by Mrs. Hall and the room tidied up. And on
			the table under the window where the stranger had been wont to work, Cuss had
			hit almost at once on three big books in manuscript labelled
			&ldquo;Diary.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Diary!&rdquo; said Cuss, putting the three books on the table.
			&ldquo;Now, at any rate, we shall learn something.&rdquo; The Vicar stood with
			his hands on the table.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Diary,&rdquo; repeated Cuss, sitting down, putting two volumes to
			support the third, and opening it. &ldquo;H&rsquo;m&mdash;no name on the
			fly-leaf. Bother!&mdash;cypher. And figures.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			The vicar came round to look over his shoulder.
		</p>

		<p>
			Cuss turned the pages over with a face suddenly disappointed.
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;dear me! It&rsquo;s all cypher, Bunting.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;There are no diagrams?&rdquo; asked Mr. Bunting. &ldquo;No illustrations
			throwing light&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;See for yourself,&rdquo; said Mr. Cuss. &ldquo;Some of it&rsquo;s
			mathematical and some of it&rsquo;s Russian or some such language (to judge by
			the letters), and some of it&rsquo;s Greek. Now the Greek I thought
			<i>you</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Mr. Bunting, taking out and wiping his spectacles
			and feeling suddenly very uncomfortable&mdash;for he had no Greek left in his
			mind worth talking about; &ldquo;yes&mdash;the Greek, of course, may furnish a
			clue.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find you a place.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather glance through the volumes first,&rdquo; said Mr.
			Bunting, still wiping. &ldquo;A general impression first, Cuss, and
			<i>then</i>, you know, we can go looking for clues.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He coughed, put on his glasses, arranged them fastidiously, coughed again, and
			wished something would happen to avert the seemingly inevitable exposure. Then
			he took the volume Cuss handed him in a leisurely manner. And then something
			did happen.
		</p>

		<p>
			The door opened suddenly.
		</p>

		<p>
			Both gentlemen started violently, looked round, and were relieved to see a
			sporadically rosy face beneath a furry silk hat. &ldquo;Tap?&rdquo; asked the
			face, and stood staring.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said both gentlemen at once.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Over the other side, my man,&rdquo; said Mr. Bunting. And &ldquo;Please
			shut that door,&rdquo; said Mr. Cuss, irritably.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the intruder, as it seemed in a low voice
			curiously different from the huskiness of its first inquiry. &ldquo;Right you
			are,&rdquo; said the intruder in the former voice. &ldquo;Stand clear!&rdquo;
			and he vanished and closed the door.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;A sailor, I should judge,&rdquo; said Mr. Bunting. &ldquo;Amusing
			fellows, they are. Stand clear! indeed. A nautical term, referring to his
			getting back out of the room, I suppose.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I daresay so,&rdquo; said Cuss. &ldquo;My nerves are all loose to-day.
			It quite made me jump&mdash;the door opening like that.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Mr. Bunting smiled as if he had not jumped. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said with
			a sigh, &ldquo;these books.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Someone sniffed as he did so.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;One thing is indisputable,&rdquo; said Bunting, drawing up a chair next
			to that of Cuss. &ldquo;There certainly have been very strange things happen in
			Iping during the last few days&mdash;very strange. I cannot of course believe
			in this absurd invisibility story&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s incredible,&rdquo; said Cuss&mdash;&ldquo;incredible. But the
			fact remains that I saw&mdash;I certainly saw right down his
			sleeve&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But did you&mdash;are you sure? Suppose a mirror, for instance&mdash;
			hallucinations are so easily produced. I don&rsquo;t know if you have ever seen
			a really good conjuror&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t argue again,&rdquo; said Cuss. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve thrashed
			that out, Bunting. And just now there&rsquo;s these books&mdash;Ah!
			here&rsquo;s some of what I take to be Greek! Greek letters certainly.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He pointed to the middle of the page. Mr. Bunting flushed slightly and brought
			his face nearer, apparently finding some difficulty with his glasses. Suddenly
			he became aware of a strange feeling at the nape of his neck. He tried to raise
			his head, and encountered an immovable resistance. The feeling was a curious
			pressure, the grip of a heavy, firm hand, and it bore his chin irresistibly to
			the table. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move, little men,&rdquo; whispered a voice,
			&ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll brain you both!&rdquo; He looked into the face of Cuss,
			close to his own, and each saw a horrified reflection of his own sickly
			astonishment.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to handle you so roughly,&rdquo; said the Voice,
			&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s unavoidable.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Since when did you learn to pry into an investigator&rsquo;s private
			memoranda,&rdquo; said the Voice; and two chins struck the table
			simultaneously, and two sets of teeth rattled.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Since when did you learn to invade the private rooms of a man in
			misfortune?&rdquo; and the concussion was repeated.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Where have they put my clothes?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said the Voice. &ldquo;The windows are fastened and
			I&rsquo;ve taken the key out of the door. I am a fairly strong man, and I have
			the poker handy&mdash;besides being invisible. There&rsquo;s not the slightest
			doubt that I could kill you both and get away quite easily if I wanted
			to&mdash;do you understand? Very well. If I let you go will you promise not to
			try any nonsense and do what I tell you?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			The vicar and the doctor looked at one another, and the doctor pulled a face.
			&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Bunting, and the doctor repeated it. Then the
			pressure on the necks relaxed, and the doctor and the vicar sat up, both very
			red in the face and wriggling their heads.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Please keep sitting where you are,&rdquo; said the Invisible Man.
			&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the poker, you see.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;When I came into this room,&rdquo; continued the Invisible Man, after
			presenting the poker to the tip of the nose of each of his visitors, &ldquo;I
			did not expect to find it occupied, and I expected to find, in addition to my
			books of memoranda, an outfit of clothing. Where is it? No&mdash;don&rsquo;t
			rise. I can see it&rsquo;s gone. Now, just at present, though the days are
			quite warm enough for an invisible man to run about stark, the evenings are
			quite chilly. I want clothing&mdash;and other accommodation; and I must also
			have those three books.&rdquo;

		<h2><a name="chap12"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br />
			THE INVISIBLE MAN LOSES HIS TEMPER</h2>

		<p>
			It is unavoidable that at this point the narrative should break off again, for
			a certain very painful reason that will presently be apparent. While these
			things were going on in the parlour, and while Mr. Huxter was watching Mr.
			Marvel smoking his pipe against the gate, not a dozen yards away were Mr. Hall
			and Teddy Henfrey discussing in a state of cloudy puzzlement the one Iping
			topic.
		</p>

		<p>
			Suddenly there came a violent thud against the door of the parlour, a sharp
			cry, and then&mdash;silence.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Hul-lo!&rdquo; said Teddy Henfrey.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Hul-lo!&rdquo; from the Tap.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mr. Hall took things in slowly but surely. &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t
			right,&rdquo; he said, and came round from behind the bar towards the parlour
			door.
		</p>

		<p>
			He and Teddy approached the door together, with intent faces. Their eyes
			considered. &ldquo;Summat wrong,&rdquo; said Hall, and Henfrey nodded
			agreement. Whiffs of an unpleasant chemical odour met them, and there was a
			muffled sound of conversation, very rapid and subdued.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You all right thur?&rdquo; asked Hall, rapping.
		</p>

		<p>
			The muttered conversation ceased abruptly, for a moment silence, then the
			conversation was resumed, in hissing whispers, then a sharp cry of &ldquo;No!
			no, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; There came a sudden motion and the oversetting of a
			chair, a brief struggle. Silence again.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What the dooce?&rdquo; exclaimed Henfrey, <i>sotto voce</i>.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You&mdash;all&mdash;right thur?&rdquo; asked Mr. Hall, sharply, again.
		</p>

		<p>
			The Vicar&rsquo;s voice answered with a curious jerking intonation:
			&ldquo;Quite ri-right. Please don&rsquo;t&mdash;interrupt.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Odd!&rdquo; said Mr. Henfrey.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Odd!&rdquo; said Mr. Hall.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Says, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Henfrey.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I heerd&rsquo;n,&rdquo; said Hall.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;And a sniff,&rdquo; said Henfrey.
		</p>

		<p>
			They remained listening. The conversation was rapid and subdued. &ldquo;I
			<i>can&rsquo;t</i>,&rdquo; said Mr. Bunting, his voice rising; &ldquo;I tell
			you, sir, I <i>will</i> not.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; asked Henfrey.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Says he wi&rsquo; nart,&rdquo; said Hall. &ldquo;Warn&rsquo;t speaking
			to us, wuz he?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Disgraceful!&rdquo; said Mr. Bunting, within.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;&lsquo;Disgraceful,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Mr. Henfrey. &ldquo;I heard
			it&mdash;distinct.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that speaking now?&rdquo; asked Henfrey.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Mr. Cuss, I s&rsquo;pose,&rdquo; said Hall. &ldquo;Can you
			hear&mdash;anything?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Silence. The sounds within indistinct and perplexing.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Sounds like throwing the table-cloth about,&rdquo; said Hall.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mrs. Hall appeared behind the bar. Hall made gestures of silence and
			invitation. This aroused Mrs. Hall&rsquo;s wifely opposition. &ldquo;What yer
			listenin&rsquo; there for, Hall?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you
			nothin&rsquo; better to do&mdash;busy day like this?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Hall tried to convey everything by grimaces and dumb show, but Mrs. Hall was
			obdurate. She raised her voice. So Hall and Henfrey, rather crestfallen,
			tiptoed back to the bar, gesticulating to explain to her.
		</p>

		<p>
			At first she refused to see anything in what they had heard at all. Then she
			insisted on Hall keeping silence, while Henfrey told her his story. She was
			inclined to think the whole business nonsense&mdash;perhaps they were just
			moving the furniture about. &ldquo;I heerd&rsquo;n say
			&lsquo;disgraceful&rsquo;; <i>that</i> I did,&rdquo; said Hall.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;<i>I</i> heerd that, Mrs. Hall,&rdquo; said Henfrey.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Like as not&mdash;&rdquo; began Mrs. Hall.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Hsh!&rdquo; said Mr. Teddy Henfrey. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I hear the
			window?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What window?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Hall.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Parlour window,&rdquo; said Henfrey.
		</p>

		<p>
			Everyone stood listening intently. Mrs. Hall&rsquo;s eyes, directed straight
			before her, saw without seeing the brilliant oblong of the inn door, the road
			white and vivid, and Huxter&rsquo;s shop-front blistering in the June sun.
			Abruptly Huxter&rsquo;s door opened and Huxter appeared, eyes staring with
			excitement, arms gesticulating. &ldquo;Yap!&rdquo; cried Huxter. &ldquo;Stop
			thief!&rdquo; and he ran obliquely across the oblong towards the yard gates,
			and vanished.
		</p>

		<p>
			Simultaneously came a tumult from the parlour, and a sound of windows being
			closed.
		</p>

		<p>
			Hall, Henfrey, and the human contents of the tap rushed out at once pell-mell
			into the street. They saw someone whisk round the corner towards the road, and
			Mr. Huxter executing a complicated leap in the air that ended on his face and
			shoulder. Down the street people were standing astonished or running towards
			them.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mr. Huxter was stunned. Henfrey stopped to discover this, but Hall and the two
			labourers from the Tap rushed at once to the corner, shouting incoherent
			things, and saw Mr. Marvel vanishing by the corner of the church wall. They
			appear to have jumped to the impossible conclusion that this was the Invisible
			Man suddenly become visible, and set off at once along the lane in pursuit. But
			Hall had hardly run a dozen yards before he gave a loud shout of astonishment
			and went flying headlong sideways, clutching one of the labourers and bringing
			him to the ground. He had been charged just as one charges a man at football.
			The second labourer came round in a circle, stared, and conceiving that Hall
			had tumbled over of his own accord, turned to resume the pursuit, only to be
			tripped by the ankle just as Huxter had been. Then, as the first labourer
			struggled to his feet, he was kicked sideways by a blow that might have felled
			an ox.
		</p>

		<p>
			As he went down, the rush from the direction of the village green came round
			the corner. The first to appear was the proprietor of the cocoanut shy, a burly
			man in a blue jersey. He was astonished to see the lane empty save for three
			men sprawling absurdly on the ground. And then something happened to his
			rear-most foot, and he went headlong and rolled sideways just in time to graze
			the feet of his brother and partner, following headlong. The two were then
			kicked, knelt on, fallen over, and cursed by quite a number of over-hasty
			people.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now when Hall and Henfrey and the labourers ran out of the house, Mrs. Hall,
			who had been disciplined by years of experience, remained in the bar next the
			till. And suddenly the parlour door was opened, and Mr. Cuss appeared, and
			without glancing at her rushed at once down the steps toward the corner.
			&ldquo;Hold him!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him drop that
			parcel.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He knew nothing of the existence of Marvel. For the Invisible Man had handed
			over the books and bundle in the yard. The face of Mr. Cuss was angry and
			resolute, but his costume was defective, a sort of limp white kilt that could
			only have passed muster in Greece. &ldquo;Hold him!&rdquo; he bawled.
			&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got my trousers! And every stitch of the Vicar&rsquo;s
			clothes!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;&rsquo;Tend to him in a minute!&rdquo; he cried to Henfrey as he passed
			the prostrate Huxter, and, coming round the corner to join the tumult, was
			promptly knocked off his feet into an indecorous sprawl. Somebody in full
			flight trod heavily on his finger. He yelled, struggled to regain his feet, was
			knocked against and thrown on all fours again, and became aware that he was
			involved not in a capture, but a rout. Everyone was running back to the
			village. He rose again and was hit severely behind the ear. He staggered and
			set off back to the &ldquo;Coach and Horses&rdquo; forthwith, leaping over the
			deserted Huxter, who was now sitting up, on his way.
		</p>

		<p>
			Behind him as he was halfway up the inn steps he heard a sudden yell of rage,
			rising sharply out of the confusion of cries, and a sounding smack in
			someone&rsquo;s face. He recognised the voice as that of the Invisible Man, and
			the note was that of a man suddenly infuriated by a painful blow.
		</p>

		<p>
			In another moment Mr. Cuss was back in the parlour. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming
			back, Bunting!&rdquo; he said, rushing in. &ldquo;Save yourself!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Mr. Bunting was standing in the window engaged in an attempt to clothe himself
			in the hearth-rug and a <i>West Surrey Gazette</i>. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
			coming?&rdquo; he said, so startled that his costume narrowly escaped
			disintegration.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Invisible Man,&rdquo; said Cuss, and rushed on to the window.
			&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better clear out from here! He&rsquo;s fighting mad!
			Mad!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			In another moment he was out in the yard.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; said Mr. Bunting, hesitating between two horrible
			alternatives. He heard a frightful struggle in the passage of the inn, and his
			decision was made. He clambered out of the window, adjusted his costume
			hastily, and fled up the village as fast as his fat little legs would carry
			him.
		</p>

		<p>
			From the moment when the Invisible Man screamed with rage and Mr. Bunting made
			his memorable flight up the village, it became impossible to give a consecutive
			account of affairs in Iping. Possibly the Invisible Man&rsquo;s original
			intention was simply to cover Marvel&rsquo;s retreat with the clothes and
			books. But his temper, at no time very good, seems to have gone completely at
			some chance blow, and forthwith he set to smiting and overthrowing, for the
			mere satisfaction of hurting.
		</p>

		<p>
			You must figure the street full of running figures, of doors slamming and
			fights for hiding-places. You must figure the tumult suddenly striking on the
			unstable equilibrium of old Fletcher&rsquo;s planks and two chairs&mdash;with
			cataclysmic results. You must figure an appalled couple caught dismally in a
			swing. And then the whole tumultuous rush has passed and the Iping street with
			its gauds and flags is deserted save for the still raging unseen, and littered
			with cocoanuts, overthrown canvas screens, and the scattered stock in trade of
			a sweetstuff stall. Everywhere there is a sound of closing shutters and shoving
			bolts, and the only visible humanity is an occasional flitting eye under a
			raised eyebrow in the corner of a window pane.
		</p>

		<p>
			The Invisible Man amused himself for a little while by breaking all the windows
			in the &ldquo;Coach and Horses,&rdquo; and then he thrust a street lamp through
			the parlour window of Mrs. Gribble. He it must have been who cut the telegraph
			wire to Adderdean just beyond Higgins&rsquo; cottage on the Adderdean road. And
			after that, as his peculiar qualities allowed, he passed out of human
			perceptions altogether, and he was neither heard, seen, nor felt in Iping any
			more. He vanished absolutely.
		</p>

		<p>
			But it was the best part of two hours before any human being ventured out again
			into the desolation of Iping street.

		<h2><a name="chap13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
			MR. MARVEL DISCUSSES HIS RESIGNATION</h2>

		<p>
			When the dusk was gathering and Iping was just beginning to peep timorously
			forth again upon the shattered wreckage of its Bank Holiday, a short, thick-set
			man in a shabby silk hat was marching painfully through the twilight behind the
			beechwoods on the road to Bramblehurst. He carried three books bound together
			by some sort of ornamental elastic ligature, and a bundle wrapped in a blue
			table-cloth. His rubicund face expressed consternation and fatigue; he appeared
			to be in a spasmodic sort of hurry. He was accompanied by a voice other than
			his own, and ever and again he winced under the touch of unseen hands.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;If you give me the slip again,&rdquo; said the Voice, &ldquo;if you
			attempt to give me the slip again&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel. &ldquo;That shoulder&rsquo;s a mass of
			bruises as it is.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;On my honour,&rdquo; said the Voice, &ldquo;I will kill you.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t try to give you the slip,&rdquo; said Marvel, in a voice
			that was not far remote from tears. &ldquo;I swear I didn&rsquo;t. I
			didn&rsquo;t know the blessed turning, that was all! How the devil was I to
			know the blessed turning? As it is, I&rsquo;ve been knocked about&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get knocked about a great deal more if you don&rsquo;t
			mind,&rdquo; said the Voice, and Mr. Marvel abruptly became silent. He blew out
			his cheeks, and his eyes were eloquent of despair.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough to let these floundering yokels explode my little
			secret, without <i>your</i> cutting off with my books. It&rsquo;s lucky for
			some of them they cut and ran when they did! Here am I ... No one knew I was
			invisible! And now what am I to do?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What am <i>I</i> to do?&rdquo; asked Marvel, <i>sotto voce</i>.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about. It will be in the papers! Everybody will be
			looking for me; everyone on their guard&mdash;&rdquo; The Voice broke off into
			vivid curses and ceased.
		</p>

		<p>
			The despair of Mr. Marvel&rsquo;s face deepened, and his pace slackened.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; said the Voice.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mr. Marvel&rsquo;s face assumed a greyish tint between the ruddier patches.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drop those books, stupid,&rdquo; said the Voice,
			sharply&mdash;overtaking him.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said the Voice, &ldquo;I shall have to make use of
			you.... You&rsquo;re a poor tool, but I must.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a <i>miserable</i> tool,&rdquo; said Marvel.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You are,&rdquo; said the Voice.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the worst possible tool you could have,&rdquo; said Marvel.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not strong,&rdquo; he said after a discouraging silence.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not over strong,&rdquo; he repeated.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;No?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;And my heart&rsquo;s weak. That little business&mdash;I pulled it
			through, of course&mdash;but bless you! I could have dropped.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the nerve and strength for the sort of thing you
			want.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> stimulate you.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t. I wouldn&rsquo;t like to mess up your plans,
			you know. But I might&mdash;out of sheer funk and misery.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not,&rdquo; said the Voice, with quiet emphasis.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I wish I was dead,&rdquo; said Marvel.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t justice,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you must admit.... It
			seems to me I&rsquo;ve a perfect right&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;<i>Get</i> on!&rdquo; said the Voice.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mr. Marvel mended his pace, and for a time they went in silence again.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s devilish hard,&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel.
		</p>

		<p>
			This was quite ineffectual. He tried another tack.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What do I make by it?&rdquo; he began again in a tone of unendurable
			wrong.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Oh! <i>shut up</i>!&rdquo; said the Voice, with sudden amazing vigour.
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see to you all right. You do what you&rsquo;re told.
			You&rsquo;ll do it all right. You&rsquo;re a fool and all that, but
			you&rsquo;ll do&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I tell you, sir, I&rsquo;m not the man for it. Respectfully&mdash;but it
			<i>is</i> so&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t shut up I shall twist your wrist again,&rdquo; said
			the Invisible Man. &ldquo;I want to think.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Presently two oblongs of yellow light appeared through the trees, and the
			square tower of a church loomed through the gloaming. &ldquo;I shall keep my
			hand on your shoulder,&rdquo; said the Voice, &ldquo;all through the village.
			Go straight through and try no foolery. It will be the worse for you if you
			do.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; sighed Mr. Marvel, &ldquo;I know all that.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			The unhappy-looking figure in the obsolete silk hat passed up the street of the
			little village with his burdens, and vanished into the gathering darkness
			beyond the lights of the windows.

		<h2><a name="chap14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
			AT PORT STOWE</h2>

		<p>
			Ten o&rsquo;clock the next morning found Mr. Marvel, unshaven, dirty, and
			travel-stained, sitting with the books beside him and his hands deep in his
			pockets, looking very weary, nervous, and uncomfortable, and inflating his
			cheeks at infrequent intervals, on the bench outside a little inn on the
			outskirts of Port Stowe. Beside him were the books, but now they were tied with
			string. The bundle had been abandoned in the pine-woods beyond Bramblehurst, in
			accordance with a change in the plans of the Invisible Man. Mr. Marvel sat on
			the bench, and although no one took the slightest notice of him, his agitation
			remained at fever heat. His hands would go ever and again to his various
			pockets with a curious nervous fumbling.
		</p>

		<p>
			When he had been sitting for the best part of an hour, however, an elderly
			mariner, carrying a newspaper, came out of the inn and sat down beside him.
			&ldquo;Pleasant day,&rdquo; said the mariner.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mr. Marvel glanced about him with something very like terror.
			&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; he said.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Just seasonable weather for the time of year,&rdquo; said the mariner,
			taking no denial.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel.
		</p>

		<p>
			The mariner produced a toothpick, and (saving his regard) was engrossed thereby
			for some minutes. His eyes meanwhile were at liberty to examine Mr.
			Marvel&rsquo;s dusty figure, and the books beside him. As he had approached Mr.
			Marvel he had heard a sound like the dropping of coins into a pocket. He was
			struck by the contrast of Mr. Marvel&rsquo;s appearance with this suggestion of
			opulence. Thence his mind wandered back again to a topic that had taken a
			curiously firm hold of his imagination.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Books?&rdquo; he said suddenly, noisily finishing with the toothpick.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mr. Marvel started and looked at them. &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he said.
			&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re books.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some extra-ordinary things in books,&rdquo; said the
			mariner.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;And some extra-ordinary things out of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said the
			mariner.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;True likewise,&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel. He eyed his interlocutor, and
			then glanced about him.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some extra-ordinary things in newspapers, for
			example,&rdquo; said the mariner.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;There are.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;In <i>this</i> newspaper,&rdquo; said the mariner.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a story,&rdquo; said the mariner, fixing Mr. Marvel with
			an eye that was firm and deliberate; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a story about an
			Invisible Man, for instance.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Mr. Marvel pulled his mouth askew and scratched his cheek and felt his ears
			glowing. &ldquo;What will they be writing next?&rdquo; he asked faintly.
			&ldquo;Ostria, or America?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; said the mariner. &ldquo;<i>Here</i>.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel, starting.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;When I say <i>here</i>,&rdquo; said the mariner, to Mr. Marvel&rsquo;s
			intense relief, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t of course mean here in this place, I mean
			hereabouts.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;An Invisible Man!&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel. &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s
			<i>he</i> been up to?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; said the mariner, controlling Marvel with his eye,
			and then amplifying, &ldquo;every&mdash;blessed&mdash;thing.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t seen a paper these four days,&rdquo; said Marvel.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Iping&rsquo;s the place he started at,&rdquo; said the mariner.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;In-<i>deed</i>!&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;He started there. And where he came from, nobody don&rsquo;t seem to
			know. Here it is: &lsquo;Pe-culiar Story from Iping.&rsquo; And it says in this
			paper that the evidence is extra-ordinary strong&mdash;extra-ordinary.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But then, it&rsquo;s an extra-ordinary story. There is a clergyman and a
			medical gent witnesses&mdash;saw &rsquo;im all right and proper&mdash;or
			leastways didn&rsquo;t see &rsquo;im. He was staying, it says, at the
			&lsquo;Coach an&rsquo; Horses,&rsquo; and no one don&rsquo;t seem to have been
			aware of his misfortune, it says, aware of his misfortune, until in an
			Altercation in the inn, it says, his bandages on his head was torn off. It was
			then ob-served that his head was invisible. Attempts were At Once made to
			secure him, but casting off his garments, it says, he succeeded in escaping,
			but not until after a desperate struggle, in which he had inflicted serious
			injuries, it says, on our worthy and able constable, Mr. J. A. Jaffers. Pretty
			straight story, eh? Names and everything.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel, looking nervously about him, trying to
			count the money in his pockets by his unaided sense of touch, and full of a
			strange and novel idea. &ldquo;It sounds most astonishing.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t it? Extra-ordinary, <i>I</i> call it. Never heard tell of
			Invisible Men before, I haven&rsquo;t, but nowadays one hears such a lot of
			extra-ordinary things&mdash;that&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;That all he did?&rdquo; asked Marvel, trying to seem at his ease.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said the mariner.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t go Back by any chance?&rdquo; asked Marvel. &ldquo;Just
			escaped and that&rsquo;s all, eh?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;All!&rdquo; said the mariner. &ldquo;Why!&mdash;ain&rsquo;t it
			enough?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Quite enough,&rdquo; said Marvel.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I should think it was enough,&rdquo; said the mariner. &ldquo;I should
			think it was enough.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t have any pals&mdash;it don&rsquo;t say he had any pals,
			does it?&rdquo; asked Mr. Marvel, anxious.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t one of a sort enough for you?&rdquo; asked the mariner.
			&ldquo;No, thank Heaven, as one might say, he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He nodded his head slowly. &ldquo;It makes me regular uncomfortable, the bare
			thought of that chap running about the country! He is at present At Large, and
			from certain evidence it is supposed that he has&mdash;taken&mdash;<i>took</i>,
			I suppose they mean&mdash;the road to Port Stowe. You see we&rsquo;re right
			<i>in</i> it! None of your American wonders, this time. And just think of the
			things he might do! Where&rsquo;d you be, if he took a drop over and above, and
			had a fancy to go for you? Suppose he wants to rob&mdash;who can prevent him?
			He can trespass, he can burgle, he could walk through a cordon of policemen as
			easy as me or you could give the slip to a blind man! Easier! For these here
			blind chaps hear uncommon sharp, I&rsquo;m told. And wherever there was liquor
			he fancied&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a tremenjous advantage, certainly,&rdquo; said Mr.
			Marvel. &ldquo;And&mdash;well...&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said the mariner. &ldquo;He
			<i>has</i>.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			All this time Mr. Marvel had been glancing about him intently, listening for
			faint footfalls, trying to detect imperceptible movements. He seemed on the
			point of some great resolution. He coughed behind his hand.
		</p>

		<p>
			He looked about him again, listened, bent towards the mariner, and lowered his
			voice: &ldquo;The fact of it is&mdash;I happen&mdash;to know just a thing or
			two about this Invisible Man. From private sources.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the mariner, interested. &ldquo;<i>You</i>?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel. &ldquo;Me.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said the mariner. &ldquo;And may I ask&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be astonished,&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel behind his hand.
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tremenjous.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said the mariner.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; began Mr. Marvel eagerly in a confidential
			undertone. Suddenly his expression changed marvellously. &ldquo;Ow!&rdquo; he
			said. He rose stiffly in his seat. His face was eloquent of physical suffering.
			&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; he said.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; said the mariner, concerned.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Toothache,&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel, and put his hand to his ear. He
			caught hold of his books. &ldquo;I must be getting on, I think,&rdquo; he said.
			He edged in a curious way along the seat away from his interlocutor. &ldquo;But
			you was just a-going to tell me about this here Invisible Man!&rdquo; protested
			the mariner. Mr. Marvel seemed to consult with himself. &ldquo;Hoax,&rdquo;
			said a Voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hoax,&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s in the paper,&rdquo; said the mariner.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Hoax all the same,&rdquo; said Marvel. &ldquo;I know the chap that
			started the lie. There ain&rsquo;t no Invisible Man
			whatsoever&mdash;Blimey.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But how &rsquo;bout this paper? D&rsquo;you mean to say&mdash;?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Not a word of it,&rdquo; said Marvel, stoutly.
		</p>

		<p>
			The mariner stared, paper in hand. Mr. Marvel jerkily faced about. &ldquo;Wait
			a bit,&rdquo; said the mariner, rising and speaking slowly, &ldquo;D&rsquo;you
			mean to say&mdash;?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Mr. Marvel.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Then why did you let me go on and tell you all this blarsted stuff,
			then? What d&rsquo;yer mean by letting a man make a fool of himself like that
			for? Eh?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Mr. Marvel blew out his cheeks. The mariner was suddenly very red indeed; he
			clenched his hands. &ldquo;I been talking here this ten minutes,&rdquo; he
			said; &ldquo;and you, you little pot-bellied, leathery-faced son of an old
			boot, couldn&rsquo;t have the elementary manners&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you come bandying words with <i>me</i>,&rdquo; said Mr.
			Marvel.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Bandying words! I&rsquo;m a jolly good mind&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Come up,&rdquo; said a Voice, and Mr. Marvel was suddenly whirled about
			and started marching off in a curious spasmodic manner. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
			better move on,&rdquo; said the mariner. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s moving on?&rdquo;
			said Mr. Marvel. He was receding obliquely with a curious hurrying gait, with
			occasional violent jerks forward. Some way along the road he began a muttered
			monologue, protests and recriminations.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Silly devil!&rdquo; said the mariner, legs wide apart, elbows akimbo,
			watching the receding figure. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you, you silly
			ass&mdash;hoaxing <i>me</i>! It&rsquo;s here&mdash;on the paper!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Mr. Marvel retorted incoherently and, receding, was hidden by a bend in the
			road, but the mariner still stood magnificent in the midst of the way, until
			the approach of a butcher&rsquo;s cart dislodged him. Then he turned himself
			towards Port Stowe. &ldquo;Full of extra-ordinary asses,&rdquo; he said softly
			to himself. &ldquo;Just to take me down a bit&mdash;that was his silly
			game&mdash;It&rsquo;s on the paper!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			And there was another extraordinary thing he was presently to hear, that had
			happened quite close to him. And that was a vision of a &ldquo;fist full of
			money&rdquo; (no less) travelling without visible agency, along by the wall at
			the corner of St. Michael&rsquo;s Lane. A brother mariner had seen this
			wonderful sight that very morning. He had snatched at the money forthwith and
			had been knocked headlong, and when he had got to his feet the butterfly money
			had vanished. Our mariner was in the mood to believe anything, he declared, but
			that was a bit <i>too</i> stiff. Afterwards, however, he began to think things
			over.
		</p>

		<p>
			The story of the flying money was true. And all about that neighbourhood, even
			from the august London and Country Banking Company, from the tills of shops and
			inns&mdash;doors standing that sunny weather entirely open&mdash;money had been
			quietly and dexterously making off that day in handfuls and rouleaux, floating
			quietly along by walls and shady places, dodging quickly from the approaching
			eyes of men. And it had, though no man had traced it, invariably ended its
			mysterious flight in the pocket of that agitated gentleman in the obsolete silk
			hat, sitting outside the little inn on the outskirts of Port Stowe.
		</p>

		<p>
			It was ten days after&mdash;and indeed only when the Burdock story was already
			old&mdash;that the mariner collated these facts and began to understand how
			near he had been to the wonderful Invisible Man.

		<h2><a name="chap15"></a>CHAPTER XV.<br />
			THE MAN WHO WAS RUNNING</h2>

		<p>
			In the early evening time Dr. Kemp was sitting in his study in the belvedere on
			the hill overlooking Burdock. It was a pleasant little room, with three
			windows&mdash;north, west, and south&mdash;and bookshelves covered with books
			and scientific publications, and a broad writing-table, and, under the north
			window, a microscope, glass slips, minute instruments, some cultures, and
			scattered bottles of reagents. Dr. Kemp&rsquo;s solar lamp was lit, albeit the
			sky was still bright with the sunset light, and his blinds were up because
			there was no offence of peering outsiders to require them pulled down. Dr. Kemp
			was a tall and slender young man, with flaxen hair and a moustache almost
			white, and the work he was upon would earn him, he hoped, the fellowship of the
			Royal Society, so highly did he think of it.
		</p>

		<p>
			And his eye, presently wandering from his work, caught the sunset blazing at
			the back of the hill that is over against his own. For a minute perhaps he sat,
			pen in mouth, admiring the rich golden colour above the crest, and then his
			attention was attracted by the little figure of a man, inky black, running over
			the hill-brow towards him. He was a shortish little man, and he wore a high
			hat, and he was running so fast that his legs verily twinkled.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Another of those fools,&rdquo; said Dr. Kemp. &ldquo;Like that ass who
			ran into me this morning round a corner, with the &lsquo;&rsquo;Visible Man
			a-coming, sir!&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t imagine what possesses people. One might
			think we were in the thirteenth century.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He got up, went to the window, and stared at the dusky hillside, and the dark
			little figure tearing down it. &ldquo;He seems in a confounded hurry,&rdquo;
			said Dr. Kemp, &ldquo;but he doesn&rsquo;t seem to be getting on. If his
			pockets were full of lead, he couldn&rsquo;t run heavier.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Spurted, sir,&rdquo; said Dr. Kemp.
		</p>

		<p>
			In another moment the higher of the villas that had clambered up the hill from
			Burdock had occulted the running figure. He was visible again for a moment, and
			again, and then again, three times between the three detached houses that came
			next, and then the terrace hid him.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Asses!&rdquo; said Dr. Kemp, swinging round on his heel and walking back
			to his writing-table.
		</p>

		<p>
			But those who saw the fugitive nearer, and perceived the abject terror on his
			perspiring face, being themselves in the open roadway, did not share in the
			doctor&rsquo;s contempt. By the man pounded, and as he ran he chinked like a
			well-filled purse that is tossed to and fro. He looked neither to the right nor
			the left, but his dilated eyes stared straight downhill to where the lamps were
			being lit, and the people were crowded in the street. And his ill-shaped mouth
			fell apart, and a glairy foam lay on his lips, and his breath came hoarse and
			noisy. All he passed stopped and began staring up the road and down, and
			interrogating one another with an inkling of discomfort for the reason of his
			haste.
		</p>

		<p>
			And then presently, far up the hill, a dog playing in the road yelped and ran
			under a gate, and as they still wondered something&mdash;a wind&mdash;a pad,
			pad, pad,&mdash;a sound like a panting breathing, rushed by.
		</p>

		<p>
			People screamed. People sprang off the pavement: It passed in shouts, it passed
			by instinct down the hill. They were shouting in the street before Marvel was
			halfway there. They were bolting into houses and slamming the doors behind
			them, with the news. He heard it and made one last desperate spurt. Fear came
			striding by, rushed ahead of him, and in a moment had seized the town.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;The Invisible Man is coming! The Invisible Man!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<h2><a name="chap16"></a>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
			IN THE &ldquo;JOLLY CRICKETERS&rdquo;</h2>

		<p>
			The &ldquo;Jolly Cricketers&rdquo; is just at the bottom of the hill, where the
			tram-lines begin. The barman leant his fat red arms on the counter and talked
			of horses with an anaemic cabman, while a black-bearded man in grey snapped up
			biscuit and cheese, drank Burton, and conversed in American with a policeman
			off duty.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the shouting about!&rdquo; said the anaemic cabman, going
			off at a tangent, trying to see up the hill over the dirty yellow blind in the
			low window of the inn. Somebody ran by outside. &ldquo;Fire, perhaps,&rdquo;
			said the barman.
		</p>

		<p>
			Footsteps approached, running heavily, the door was pushed open violently, and
			Marvel, weeping and dishevelled, his hat gone, the neck of his coat torn open,
			rushed in, made a convulsive turn, and attempted to shut the door. It was held
			half open by a strap.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Coming!&rdquo; he bawled, his voice shrieking with terror.
			&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming. The &rsquo;Visible Man! After me! For Gawd&rsquo;s
			sake! &rsquo;Elp! &rsquo;Elp! &rsquo;Elp!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Shut the doors,&rdquo; said the policeman. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s coming?
			What&rsquo;s the row?&rdquo; He went to the door, released the strap, and it
			slammed. The American closed the other door.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Lemme go inside,&rdquo; said Marvel, staggering and weeping, but still
			clutching the books. &ldquo;Lemme go inside. Lock me in&mdash;somewhere. I tell
			you he&rsquo;s after me. I give him the slip. He said he&rsquo;d kill me and he
			will.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;re</i> safe,&rdquo; said the man with the black beard.
			&ldquo;The door&rsquo;s shut. What&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Lemme go inside,&rdquo; said Marvel, and shrieked aloud as a blow
			suddenly made the fastened door shiver and was followed by a hurried rapping
			and a shouting outside. &ldquo;Hullo,&rdquo; cried the policeman,
			&ldquo;who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; Mr. Marvel began to make frantic dives at
			panels that looked like doors. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll kill me&mdash;he&rsquo;s got
			a knife or something. For Gawd&rsquo;s sake&mdash;!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Here you are,&rdquo; said the barman. &ldquo;Come in here.&rdquo; And he
			held up the flap of the bar.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mr. Marvel rushed behind the bar as the summons outside was repeated.
			&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t open the door,&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;<i>Please</i>
			don&rsquo;t open the door. <i>Where</i> shall I hide?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;This, this Invisible Man, then?&rdquo; asked the man with the black
			beard, with one hand behind him. &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s about time we saw
			him.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			The window of the inn was suddenly smashed in, and there was a screaming and
			running to and fro in the street. The policeman had been standing on the settee
			staring out, craning to see who was at the door. He got down with raised
			eyebrows. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; he said. The barman stood in front of
			the bar-parlour door which was now locked on Mr. Marvel, stared at the smashed
			window, and came round to the two other men.
		</p>

		<p>
			Everything was suddenly quiet. &ldquo;I wish I had my truncheon,&rdquo; said
			the policeman, going irresolutely to the door. &ldquo;Once we open, in he
			comes. There&rsquo;s no stopping him.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be in too much hurry about that door,&rdquo; said the
			anaemic cabman, anxiously.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Draw the bolts,&rdquo; said the man with the black beard, &ldquo;and if
			he comes&mdash;&rdquo; He showed a revolver in his hand.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said the policeman; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
			murder.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I know what country I&rsquo;m in,&rdquo; said the man with the beard.
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to let off at his legs. Draw the bolts.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Not with that blinking thing going off behind me,&rdquo; said the
			barman, craning over the blind.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the man with the black beard, and stooping down,
			revolver ready, drew them himself. Barman, cabman, and policeman faced about.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said the bearded man in an undertone, standing back and
			facing the unbolted doors with his pistol behind him. No one came in, the door
			remained closed. Five minutes afterwards when a second cabman pushed his head
			in cautiously, they were still waiting, and an anxious face peered out of the
			bar-parlour and supplied information. &ldquo;Are all the doors of the house
			shut?&rdquo; asked Marvel. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going round&mdash;prowling round.
			He&rsquo;s as artful as the devil.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; said the burly barman. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the back!
			Just watch them doors! I say&mdash;!&rdquo; He looked about him helplessly. The
			bar-parlour door slammed and they heard the key turn. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the
			yard door and the private door. The yard door&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He rushed out of the bar.
		</p>

		<p>
			In a minute he reappeared with a carving-knife in his hand. &ldquo;The yard
			door was open!&rdquo; he said, and his fat underlip dropped. &ldquo;He may be
			in the house now!&rdquo; said the first cabman.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not in the kitchen,&rdquo; said the barman.
			&ldquo;There&rsquo;s two women there, and I&rsquo;ve stabbed every inch of it
			with this little beef slicer. And they don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s come in.
			They haven&rsquo;t noticed&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Have you fastened it?&rdquo; asked the first cabman.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;m out of frocks,&rdquo; said the barman.
		</p>

		<p>
			The man with the beard replaced his revolver. And even as he did so the flap of
			the bar was shut down and the bolt clicked, and then with a tremendous thud the
			catch of the door snapped and the bar-parlour door burst open. They heard
			Marvel squeal like a caught leveret, and forthwith they were clambering over
			the bar to his rescue. The bearded man&rsquo;s revolver cracked and the
			looking-glass at the back of the parlour starred and came smashing and tinkling
			down.
		</p>

		<p>
			As the barman entered the room he saw Marvel, curiously crumpled up and
			struggling against the door that led to the yard and kitchen. The door flew
			open while the barman hesitated, and Marvel was dragged into the kitchen. There
			was a scream and a clatter of pans. Marvel, head down, and lugging back
			obstinately, was forced to the kitchen door, and the bolts were drawn.
		</p>

		<p>
			Then the policeman, who had been trying to pass the barman, rushed in, followed
			by one of the cabmen, gripped the wrist of the invisible hand that collared
			Marvel, was hit in the face and went reeling back. The door opened, and Marvel
			made a frantic effort to obtain a lodgment behind it. Then the cabman collared
			something. &ldquo;I got him,&rdquo; said the cabman. The barman&rsquo;s red
			hands came clawing at the unseen. &ldquo;Here he is!&rdquo; said the barman.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mr. Marvel, released, suddenly dropped to the ground and made an attempt to
			crawl behind the legs of the fighting men. The struggle blundered round the
			edge of the door. The voice of the Invisible Man was heard for the first time,
			yelling out sharply, as the policeman trod on his foot. Then he cried out
			passionately and his fists flew round like flails. The cabman suddenly whooped
			and doubled up, kicked under the diaphragm. The door into the bar-parlour from
			the kitchen slammed and covered Mr. Marvel&rsquo;s retreat. The men in the
			kitchen found themselves clutching at and struggling with empty air.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s he gone?&rdquo; cried the man with the beard.
			&ldquo;Out?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;This way,&rdquo; said the policeman, stepping into the yard and
			stopping.
		</p>

		<p>
			A piece of tile whizzed by his head and smashed among the crockery on the
			kitchen table.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show him,&rdquo; shouted the man with the black beard, and
			suddenly a steel barrel shone over the policeman&rsquo;s shoulder, and five
			bullets had followed one another into the twilight whence the missile had come.
			As he fired, the man with the beard moved his hand in a horizontal curve, so
			that his shots radiated out into the narrow yard like spokes from a wheel.
		</p>

		<p>
			A silence followed. &ldquo;Five cartridges,&rdquo; said the man with the black
			beard. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best of all. Four aces and a joker. Get a
			lantern, someone, and come and feel about for his body.&rdquo;

		<h2><a name="chap17"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
			DR. KEMP&rsquo;S VISITOR</h2>

		<p>
			Dr. Kemp had continued writing in his study until the shots aroused him. Crack,
			crack, crack, they came one after the other.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said Dr. Kemp, putting his pen into his mouth again and
			listening. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s letting off revolvers in Burdock? What are the
			asses at now?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He went to the south window, threw it up, and leaning out stared down on the
			network of windows, beaded gas-lamps and shops, with its black interstices of
			roof and yard that made up the town at night. &ldquo;Looks like a crowd down
			the hill,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;by &lsquo;The Cricketers,&rsquo;&rdquo; and
			remained watching. Thence his eyes wandered over the town to far away where the
			ships&rsquo; lights shone, and the pier glowed&mdash;a little illuminated,
			facetted pavilion like a gem of yellow light. The moon in its first quarter
			hung over the westward hill, and the stars were clear and almost tropically
			bright.
		</p>

		<p>
			After five minutes, during which his mind had travelled into a remote
			speculation of social conditions of the future, and lost itself at last over
			the time dimension, Dr. Kemp roused himself with a sigh, pulled down the window
			again, and returned to his writing desk.
		</p>

		<p>
			It must have been about an hour after this that the front-door bell rang. He
			had been writing slackly, and with intervals of abstraction, since the shots.
			He sat listening. He heard the servant answer the door, and waited for her feet
			on the staircase, but she did not come. &ldquo;Wonder what that was,&rdquo;
			said Dr. Kemp.
		</p>

		<p>
			He tried to resume his work, failed, got up, went downstairs from his study to
			the landing, rang, and called over the balustrade to the housemaid as she
			appeared in the hall below. &ldquo;Was that a letter?&rdquo; he asked.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Only a runaway ring, sir,&rdquo; she answered.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;m restless to-night,&rdquo; he said to himself. He went back to
			his study, and this time attacked his work resolutely. In a little while he was
			hard at work again, and the only sounds in the room were the ticking of the
			clock and the subdued shrillness of his quill, hurrying in the very centre of
			the circle of light his lampshade threw on his table.
		</p>

		<p>
			It was two o&rsquo;clock before Dr. Kemp had finished his work for the night.
			He rose, yawned, and went downstairs to bed. He had already removed his coat
			and vest, when he noticed that he was thirsty. He took a candle and went down
			to the dining-room in search of a syphon and whiskey.
		</p>

		<p>
			Dr. Kemp&rsquo;s scientific pursuits have made him a very observant man, and as
			he recrossed the hall, he noticed a dark spot on the linoleum near the mat at
			the foot of the stairs. He went on upstairs, and then it suddenly occurred to
			him to ask himself what the spot on the linoleum might be. Apparently some
			subconscious element was at work. At any rate, he turned with his burden, went
			back to the hall, put down the syphon and whiskey, and bending down, touched
			the spot. Without any great surprise he found it had the stickiness and colour
			of drying blood.
		</p>

		<p>
			He took up his burden again, and returned upstairs, looking about him and
			trying to account for the blood-spot. On the landing he saw something and
			stopped astonished. The door-handle of his own room was blood-stained.
		</p>

		<p>
			He looked at his own hand. It was quite clean, and then he remembered that the
			door of his room had been open when he came down from his study, and that
			consequently he had not touched the handle at all. He went straight into his
			room, his face quite calm&mdash;perhaps a trifle more resolute than usual. His
			glance, wandering inquisitively, fell on the bed. On the counterpane was a mess
			of blood, and the sheet had been torn. He had not noticed this before because
			he had walked straight to the dressing-table. On the further side the
			bedclothes were depressed as if someone had been recently sitting there.
		</p>

		<p>
			Then he had an odd impression that he had heard a low voice say, &ldquo;Good
			Heavens!&mdash;Kemp!&rdquo; But Dr. Kemp was no believer in voices.
		</p>

		<p>
			He stood staring at the tumbled sheets. Was that really a voice? He looked
			about again, but noticed nothing further than the disordered and blood-stained
			bed. Then he distinctly heard a movement across the room, near the wash-hand
			stand. All men, however highly educated, retain some superstitious inklings.
			The feeling that is called &ldquo;eerie&rdquo; came upon him. He closed the
			door of the room, came forward to the dressing-table, and put down his burdens.
			Suddenly, with a start, he perceived a coiled and blood-stained bandage of
			linen rag hanging in mid-air, between him and the wash-hand stand.
		</p>

		<p>
			He stared at this in amazement. It was an empty bandage, a bandage properly
			tied but quite empty. He would have advanced to grasp it, but a touch arrested
			him, and a voice speaking quite close to him.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Kemp!&rdquo; said the Voice.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Kemp, with his mouth open.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Keep your nerve,&rdquo; said the Voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an Invisible
			Man.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp made no answer for a space, simply stared at the bandage. &ldquo;Invisible
			Man,&rdquo; he said.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I am an Invisible Man,&rdquo; repeated the Voice.
		</p>

		<p>
			The story he had been active to ridicule only that morning rushed through
			Kemp&rsquo;s brain. He does not appear to have been either very much frightened
			or very greatly surprised at the moment. Realisation came later.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I thought it was all a lie,&rdquo; he said. The thought uppermost in his
			mind was the reiterated arguments of the morning. &ldquo;Have you a bandage
			on?&rdquo; he asked.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Invisible Man.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Kemp, and then roused himself. &ldquo;I say!&rdquo; he
			said. &ldquo;But this is nonsense. It&rsquo;s some trick.&rdquo; He stepped
			forward suddenly, and his hand, extended towards the bandage, met invisible
			fingers.
		</p>

		<p>
			He recoiled at the touch and his colour changed.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Keep steady, Kemp, for God&rsquo;s sake! I want help badly. Stop!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			The hand gripped his arm. He struck at it.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Kemp!&rdquo; cried the Voice. &ldquo;Kemp! Keep steady!&rdquo; and the
			grip tightened.
		</p>

		<p>
			A frantic desire to free himself took possession of Kemp. The hand of the
			bandaged arm gripped his shoulder, and he was suddenly tripped and flung
			backwards upon the bed. He opened his mouth to shout, and the corner of the
			sheet was thrust between his teeth. The Invisible Man had him down grimly, but
			his arms were free and he struck and tried to kick savagely.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Listen to reason, will you?&rdquo; said the Invisible Man, sticking to
			him in spite of a pounding in the ribs. &ldquo;By Heaven! you&rsquo;ll madden
			me in a minute!
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Lie still, you fool!&rdquo; bawled the Invisible Man in Kemp&rsquo;s
			ear.
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp struggled for another moment and then lay still.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;If you shout, I&rsquo;ll smash your face,&rdquo; said the Invisible Man,
			relieving his mouth.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an Invisible Man. It&rsquo;s no foolishness, and no magic. I
			really am an Invisible Man. And I want your help. I don&rsquo;t want to hurt
			you, but if you behave like a frantic rustic, I must. Don&rsquo;t you remember
			me, Kemp? Griffin, of University College?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Let me get up,&rdquo; said Kemp. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stop where I am. And
			let me sit quiet for a minute.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He sat up and felt his neck.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I am Griffin, of University College, and I have made myself invisible. I
			am just an ordinary man&mdash;a man you have known&mdash;made invisible.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Griffin?&rdquo; said Kemp.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Griffin,&rdquo; answered the Voice. A younger student than you were,
			almost an albino, six feet high, and broad, with a pink and white face and red
			eyes, who won the medal for chemistry.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I am confused,&rdquo; said Kemp. &ldquo;My brain is rioting. What has
			this to do with Griffin?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I <i>am</i> Griffin.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s horrible,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But what
			devilry must happen to make a man invisible?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no devilry. It&rsquo;s a process, sane and intelligible
			enough&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s horrible!&rdquo; said Kemp. &ldquo;How on
			earth&mdash;?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s horrible enough. But I&rsquo;m wounded and in pain, and tired
			... Great God! Kemp, you are a man. Take it steady. Give me some food and
			drink, and let me sit down here.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp stared at the bandage as it moved across the room, then saw a basket chair
			dragged across the floor and come to rest near the bed. It creaked, and the
			seat was depressed the quarter of an inch or so. He rubbed his eyes and felt
			his neck again. &ldquo;This beats ghosts,&rdquo; he said, and laughed stupidly.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better. Thank Heaven, you&rsquo;re getting sensible!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Or silly,&rdquo; said Kemp, and knuckled his eyes.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Give me some whiskey. I&rsquo;m near dead.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t feel so. Where are you? If I get up shall I run into
			you? <i>There</i>! all right. Whiskey? Here. Where shall I give it to
			you?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			The chair creaked and Kemp felt the glass drawn away from him. He let go by an
			effort; his instinct was all against it. It came to rest poised twenty inches
			above the front edge of the seat of the chair. He stared at it in infinite
			perplexity. &ldquo;This is&mdash;this must be&mdash;hypnotism. You have
			suggested you are invisible.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said the Voice.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s frantic.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Listen to me.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I demonstrated conclusively this morning,&rdquo; began Kemp, &ldquo;that
			invisibility&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Never mind what you&rsquo;ve demonstrated!&mdash;I&rsquo;m
			starving,&rdquo; said the Voice, &ldquo;and the night is chilly to a man
			without clothes.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Food?&rdquo; said Kemp.
		</p>

		<p>
			The tumbler of whiskey tilted itself. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Invisible Man
			rapping it down. &ldquo;Have you a dressing-gown?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp made some exclamation in an undertone. He walked to a wardrobe and
			produced a robe of dingy scarlet. &ldquo;This do?&rdquo; he asked. It was taken
			from him. It hung limp for a moment in mid-air, fluttered weirdly, stood full
			and decorous buttoning itself, and sat down in his chair. &ldquo;Drawers,
			socks, slippers would be a comfort,&rdquo; said the Unseen, curtly. &ldquo;And
			food.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Anything. But this is the insanest thing I ever was in, in my
			life!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He turned out his drawers for the articles, and then went downstairs to ransack
			his larder. He came back with some cold cutlets and bread, pulled up a light
			table, and placed them before his guest. &ldquo;Never mind knives,&rdquo; said
			his visitor, and a cutlet hung in mid-air, with a sound of gnawing.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Invisible!&rdquo; said Kemp, and sat down on a bedroom chair.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I always like to get something about me before I eat,&rdquo; said the
			Invisible Man, with a full mouth, eating greedily. &ldquo;Queer fancy!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I suppose that wrist is all right,&rdquo; said Kemp.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Trust me,&rdquo; said the Invisible Man.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Of all the strange and wonderful&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Exactly. But it&rsquo;s odd I should blunder into <i>your</i> house to
			get my bandaging. My first stroke of luck! Anyhow I meant to sleep in this
			house to-night. You must stand that! It&rsquo;s a filthy nuisance, my blood
			showing, isn&rsquo;t it? Quite a clot over there. Gets visible as it
			coagulates, I see. It&rsquo;s only the living tissue I&rsquo;ve changed, and
			only for as long as I&rsquo;m alive.... I&rsquo;ve been in the house three
			hours.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But how&rsquo;s it done?&rdquo; began Kemp, in a tone of exasperation.
			&ldquo;Confound it! The whole business&mdash;it&rsquo;s unreasonable from
			beginning to end.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Quite reasonable,&rdquo; said the Invisible Man. &ldquo;Perfectly
			reasonable.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He reached over and secured the whiskey bottle. Kemp stared at the devouring
			dressing gown. A ray of candle-light penetrating a torn patch in the right
			shoulder, made a triangle of light under the left ribs. &ldquo;What were the
			shots?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;How did the shooting begin?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;There was a real fool of a man&mdash;a sort of confederate of
			mine&mdash;curse him!&mdash;who tried to steal my money. <i>Has</i> done
			so.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Is <i>he</i> invisible too?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I have some more to eat before I tell you all that?
			I&rsquo;m hungry&mdash;in pain. And you want me to tell stories!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp got up. &ldquo;<i>You</i> didn&rsquo;t do any shooting?&rdquo; he asked.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; said his visitor. &ldquo;Some fool I&rsquo;d never seen
			fired at random. A lot of them got scared. They all got scared at me. Curse
			them!&mdash;I say&mdash;I want more to eat than this, Kemp.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what there is to eat downstairs,&rdquo; said Kemp.
			&ldquo;Not much, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			After he had done eating, and he made a heavy meal, the Invisible Man demanded
			a cigar. He bit the end savagely before Kemp could find a knife, and cursed
			when the outer leaf loosened. It was strange to see him smoking; his mouth, and
			throat, pharynx and nares, became visible as a sort of whirling smoke cast.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;This blessed gift of smoking!&rdquo; he said, and puffed vigorously.
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;m lucky to have fallen upon you, Kemp. You must help me. Fancy
			tumbling on you just now! I&rsquo;m in a devilish scrape&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been
			mad, I think. The things I have been through! But we will do things yet. Let me
			tell you&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He helped himself to more whiskey and soda. Kemp got up, looked about him, and
			fetched a glass from his spare room. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wild&mdash;but I suppose
			I may drink.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t changed much, Kemp, these dozen years. You fair men
			don&rsquo;t. Cool and methodical&mdash;after the first collapse. I must tell
			you. We will work together!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But how was it all done?&rdquo; said Kemp, &ldquo;and how did you get
			like this?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, let me smoke in peace for a little while! And then
			I will begin to tell you.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			But the story was not told that night. The Invisible Man&rsquo;s wrist was
			growing painful; he was feverish, exhausted, and his mind came round to brood
			upon his chase down the hill and the struggle about the inn. He spoke in
			fragments of Marvel, he smoked faster, his voice grew angry. Kemp tried to
			gather what he could.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;He was afraid of me, I could see that he was afraid of me,&rdquo; said
			the Invisible Man many times over. &ldquo;He meant to give me the slip&mdash;he
			was always casting about! What a fool I was!
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;The cur!
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I should have killed him!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Where did you get the money?&rdquo; asked Kemp, abruptly.
		</p>

		<p>
			The Invisible Man was silent for a space. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you
			to-night,&rdquo; he said.
		</p>

		<p>
			He groaned suddenly and leant forward, supporting his invisible head on
			invisible hands. &ldquo;Kemp,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had no sleep
			for near three days, except a couple of dozes of an hour or so. I must sleep
			soon.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Well, have my room&mdash;have this room.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But how can I sleep? If I sleep&mdash;he will get away. Ugh! What does
			it matter?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the shot wound?&rdquo; asked Kemp, abruptly.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;scratch and blood. Oh, God! How I want sleep!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			The Invisible Man appeared to be regarding Kemp. &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve a
			particular objection to being caught by my fellow-men,&rdquo; he said slowly.
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp started.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Fool that I am!&rdquo; said the Invisible Man, striking the table
			smartly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put the idea into your head.&rdquo;
		</p>

			THE INVISIBLE MAN SLEEPS</h2>

		<p>
			Exhausted and wounded as the Invisible Man was, he refused to accept
			Kemp&rsquo;s word that his freedom should be respected. He examined the two
			windows of the bedroom, drew up the blinds and opened the sashes, to confirm
			Kemp&rsquo;s statement that a retreat by them would be possible. Outside the
			night was very quiet and still, and the new moon was setting over the down.
			Then he examined the keys of the bedroom and the two dressing-room doors, to
			satisfy himself that these also could be made an assurance of freedom. Finally
			he expressed himself satisfied. He stood on the hearth rug and Kemp heard the
			sound of a yawn.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said the Invisible Man, &ldquo;if I cannot tell
			you all that I have done to-night. But I am worn out. It&rsquo;s grotesque, no
			doubt. It&rsquo;s horrible! But believe me, Kemp, in spite of your arguments of
			this morning, it is quite a possible thing. I have made a discovery. I meant to
			keep it to myself. I can&rsquo;t. I must have a partner. And you.... We can do
			such things ... But to-morrow. Now, Kemp, I feel as though I must sleep or
			perish.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp stood in the middle of the room staring at the headless garment. &ldquo;I
			suppose I must leave you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;incredible.
			Three things happening like this, overturning all my preconceptions&mdash;would
			make me insane. But it&rsquo;s real! Is there anything more that I can get
			you?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Only bid me good-night,&rdquo; said Griffin.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; said Kemp, and shook an invisible hand. He walked
			sideways to the door. Suddenly the dressing-gown walked quickly towards him.
			&ldquo;Understand me!&rdquo; said the dressing-gown. &ldquo;No attempts to
			hamper me, or capture me! Or&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp&rsquo;s face changed a little. &ldquo;I thought I gave you my word,&rdquo;
			he said.
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp closed the door softly behind him, and the key was turned upon him
			forthwith. Then, as he stood with an expression of passive amazement on his
			face, the rapid feet came to the door of the dressing-room and that too was
			locked. Kemp slapped his brow with his hand. &ldquo;Am I dreaming? Has the
			world gone mad&mdash;or have I?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He laughed, and put his hand to the locked door. &ldquo;Barred out of my own
			bedroom, by a flagrant absurdity!&rdquo; he said.
		</p>

		<p>
			He walked to the head of the staircase, turned, and stared at the locked doors.
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fact,&rdquo; he said. He put his fingers to his slightly
			bruised neck. &ldquo;Undeniable fact!
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He shook his head hopelessly, turned, and went downstairs.
		</p>

		<p>
			He lit the dining-room lamp, got out a cigar, and began pacing the room,
			ejaculating. Now and then he would argue with himself.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Invisible!&rdquo; he said.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Is there such a thing as an invisible animal? ... In the sea, yes.
			Thousands&mdash;millions. All the larvae, all the little nauplii and tornarias,
			all the microscopic things, the jelly-fish. In the sea there are more things
			invisible than visible! I never thought of that before. And in the ponds too!
			All those little pond-life things&mdash;specks of colourless translucent jelly!
			But in air? No!
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But after all&mdash;why not?
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;If a man was made of glass he would still be visible.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			His meditation became profound. The bulk of three cigars had passed into the
			invisible or diffused as a white ash over the carpet before he spoke again.
			Then it was merely an exclamation. He turned aside, walked out of the room, and
			went into his little consulting-room and lit the gas there. It was a little
			room, because Dr. Kemp did not live by practice, and in it were the day&rsquo;s
			newspapers. The morning&rsquo;s paper lay carelessly opened and thrown aside.
			He caught it up, turned it over, and read the account of a &ldquo;Strange Story
			from Iping&rdquo; that the mariner at Port Stowe had spelt over so painfully to
			Mr. Marvel. Kemp read it swiftly.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Wrapped up!&rdquo; said Kemp. &ldquo;Disguised! Hiding it! &lsquo;No one
			seems to have been aware of his misfortune.&rsquo; What the devil <i>is</i> his
			game?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He dropped the paper, and his eye went seeking. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, and
			caught up the <i>St. James&rsquo; Gazette</i>, lying folded up as it arrived.
			&ldquo;Now we shall get at the truth,&rdquo; said Dr. Kemp. He rent the paper
			open; a couple of columns confronted him. &ldquo;An Entire Village in Sussex
			goes Mad&rdquo; was the heading.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; said Kemp, reading eagerly an incredulous account
			of the events in Iping, of the previous afternoon, that have already been
			described. Over the leaf the report in the morning paper had been reprinted.
		</p>

		<p>
			He re-read it. &ldquo;Ran through the streets striking right and left. Jaffers
			insensible. Mr. Huxter in great pain&mdash;still unable to describe what he
			saw. Painful humiliation&mdash;vicar. Woman ill with terror! Windows smashed.
			This extraordinary story probably a fabrication. Too good not to
			print&mdash;<i>cum grano</i>!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He dropped the paper and stared blankly in front of him. &ldquo;Probably a
			fabrication!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He caught up the paper again, and re-read the whole business. &ldquo;But when
			does the Tramp come in? Why the deuce was he chasing a tramp?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He sat down abruptly on the surgical bench. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not only
			invisible,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s mad! Homicidal!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			When dawn came to mingle its pallor with the lamp-light and cigar smoke of the
			dining-room, Kemp was still pacing up and down, trying to grasp the incredible.
		</p>

		<p>
			He was altogether too excited to sleep. His servants, descending sleepily,
			discovered him, and were inclined to think that over-study had worked this ill
			on him. He gave them extraordinary but quite explicit instructions to lay
			breakfast for two in the belvedere study&mdash;and then to confine themselves
			to the basement and ground-floor. Then he continued to pace the dining-room
			until the morning&rsquo;s paper came. That had much to say and little to tell,
			beyond the confirmation of the evening before, and a very badly written account
			of another remarkable tale from Port Burdock. This gave Kemp the essence of the
			happenings at the &ldquo;Jolly Cricketers,&rdquo; and the name of Marvel.
			&ldquo;He has made me keep with him twenty-four hours,&rdquo; Marvel testified.
			Certain minor facts were added to the Iping story, notably the cutting of the
			village telegraph-wire. But there was nothing to throw light on the connexion
			between the Invisible Man and the Tramp; for Mr. Marvel had supplied no
			information about the three books, or the money with which he was lined. The
			incredulous tone had vanished and a shoal of reporters and inquirers were
			already at work elaborating the matter.
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp read every scrap of the report and sent his housemaid out to get every one
			of the morning papers she could. These also he devoured.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;He is invisible!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And it reads like rage growing
			to mania! The things he may do! The things he may do! And he&rsquo;s upstairs
			free as the air. What on earth ought I to do?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;For instance, would it be a breach of faith if&mdash;? No.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He went to a little untidy desk in the corner, and began a note. He tore this
			up half written, and wrote another. He read it over and considered it. Then he
			took an envelope and addressed it to &ldquo;Colonel Adye, Port Burdock.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			The Invisible Man awoke even as Kemp was doing this. He awoke in an evil
			temper, and Kemp, alert for every sound, heard his pattering feet rush suddenly
			across the bedroom overhead. Then a chair was flung over and the wash-hand
			stand tumbler smashed. Kemp hurried upstairs and rapped eagerly.

		<h2><a name="chap19"></a>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
			CERTAIN FIRST PRINCIPLES</h2>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Kemp, when the Invisible Man
			admitted him.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; was the answer.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But, confound it! The smash?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Fit of temper,&rdquo; said the Invisible Man. &ldquo;Forgot this arm;
			and it&rsquo;s sore.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You&rsquo;re rather liable to that sort of thing.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp walked across the room and picked up the fragments of broken glass.
			&ldquo;All the facts are out about you,&rdquo; said Kemp, standing up with the
			glass in his hand; &ldquo;all that happened in Iping, and down the hill. The
			world has become aware of its invisible citizen. But no one knows you are
			here.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			The Invisible Man swore.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;The secret&rsquo;s out. I gather it was a secret. I don&rsquo;t know
			what your plans are, but of course I&rsquo;m anxious to help you.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			The Invisible Man sat down on the bed.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;There&rsquo;s breakfast upstairs,&rdquo; said Kemp, speaking as easily
			as possible, and he was delighted to find his strange guest rose willingly.
			Kemp led the way up the narrow staircase to the belvedere.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Before we can do anything else,&rdquo; said Kemp, &ldquo;I must
			understand a little more about this invisibility of yours.&rdquo; He had sat
			down, after one nervous glance out of the window, with the air of a man who has
			talking to do. His doubts of the sanity of the entire business flashed and
			vanished again as he looked across to where Griffin sat at the
			breakfast-table&mdash;a headless, handless dressing-gown, wiping unseen lips on
			a miraculously held serviette.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s simple enough&mdash;and credible enough,&rdquo; said Griffin,
			putting the serviette aside and leaning the invisible head on an invisible
			hand.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;No doubt, to you, but&mdash;&rdquo; Kemp laughed.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Well, yes; to me it seemed wonderful at first, no doubt. But now, great
			God! ... But we will do great things yet! I came on the stuff first at
			Chesilstowe.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Chesilstowe?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I went there after I left London. You know I dropped medicine and took
			up physics? No; well, I did. <i>Light</i> fascinated me.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Optical density! The whole subject is a network of riddles&mdash;a
			network with solutions glimmering elusively through. And being but
			two-and-twenty and full of enthusiasm, I said, &lsquo;I will devote my life to
			this. This is worth while.&rsquo; You know what fools we are at
			two-and-twenty?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Fools then or fools now,&rdquo; said Kemp.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;As though knowing could be any satisfaction to a man!
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But I went to work&mdash;like a slave. And I had hardly worked and
			thought about the matter six months before light came through one of the meshes
			suddenly&mdash;blindingly! I found a general principle of pigments and
			refraction&mdash;a formula, a geometrical expression involving four dimensions.
			Fools, common men, even common mathematicians, do not know anything of what
			some general expression may mean to the student of molecular physics. In the
			books&mdash;the books that tramp has hidden&mdash;there are marvels, miracles!
			But this was not a method, it was an idea, that might lead to a method by which
			it would be possible, without changing any other property of
			matter&mdash;except, in some instances colours&mdash;to lower the refractive
			index of a substance, solid or liquid, to that of air&mdash;so far as all
			practical purposes are concerned.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; said Kemp. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd! But still I don&rsquo;t
			see quite ... I can understand that thereby you could spoil a valuable stone,
			but personal invisibility is a far cry.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said Griffin. &ldquo;But consider, visibility depends
			on the action of the visible bodies on light. Either a body absorbs light, or
			it reflects or refracts it, or does all these things. If it neither reflects
			nor refracts nor absorbs light, it cannot of itself be visible. You see an
			opaque red box, for instance, because the colour absorbs some of the light and
			reflects the rest, all the red part of the light, to you. If it did not absorb
			any particular part of the light, but reflected it all, then it would be a
			shining white box. Silver! A diamond box would neither absorb much of the light
			nor reflect much from the general surface, but just here and there where the
			surfaces were favourable the light would be reflected and refracted, so that
			you would get a brilliant appearance of flashing reflections and
			translucencies&mdash;a sort of skeleton of light. A glass box would not be so
			brilliant, nor so clearly visible, as a diamond box, because there would be
			less refraction and reflection. See that? From certain points of view you would
			see quite clearly through it. Some kinds of glass would be more visible than
			others, a box of flint glass would be brighter than a box of ordinary window
			glass. A box of very thin common glass would be hard to see in a bad light,
			because it would absorb hardly any light and refract and reflect very little.
			And if you put a sheet of common white glass in water, still more if you put it
			in some denser liquid than water, it would vanish almost altogether, because
			light passing from water to glass is only slightly refracted or reflected or
			indeed affected in any way. It is almost as invisible as a jet of coal gas or
			hydrogen is in air. And for precisely the same reason!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Kemp, &ldquo;that is pretty plain sailing.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;And here is another fact you will know to be true. If a sheet of glass
			is smashed, Kemp, and beaten into a powder, it becomes much more visible while
			it is in the air; it becomes at last an opaque white powder. This is because
			the powdering multiplies the surfaces of the glass at which refraction and
			reflection occur. In the sheet of glass there are only two surfaces; in the
			powder the light is reflected or refracted by each grain it passes through, and
			very little gets right through the powder. But if the white powdered glass is
			put into water, it forthwith vanishes. The powdered glass and water have much
			the same refractive index; that is, the light undergoes very little refraction
			or reflection in passing from one to the other.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You make the glass invisible by putting it into a liquid of nearly the
			same refractive index; a transparent thing becomes invisible if it is put in
			any medium of almost the same refractive index. And if you will consider only a
			second, you will see also that the powder of glass might be made to vanish in
			air, if its refractive index could be made the same as that of air; for then
			there would be no refraction or reflection as the light passed from glass to
			air.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Kemp. &ldquo;But a man&rsquo;s not powdered
			glass!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Griffin. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s more transparent!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;That from a doctor! How one forgets! Have you already forgotten your
			physics, in ten years? Just think of all the things that are transparent and
			seem not to be so. Paper, for instance, is made up of transparent fibres, and
			it is white and opaque only for the same reason that a powder of glass is white
			and opaque. Oil white paper, fill up the interstices between the particles with
			oil so that there is no longer refraction or reflection except at the surfaces,
			and it becomes as transparent as glass. And not only paper, but cotton fibre,
			linen fibre, wool fibre, woody fibre, and <i>bone</i>, Kemp, <i>flesh</i>,
			Kemp, <i>hair</i>, Kemp, <i>nails</i> and <i>nerves</i>, Kemp, in fact the
			whole fabric of a man except the red of his blood and the black pigment of
			hair, are all made up of transparent, colourless tissue. So little suffices to
			make us visible one to the other. For the most part the fibres of a living
			creature are no more opaque than water.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Great Heavens!&rdquo; cried Kemp. &ldquo;Of course, of course! I was
			thinking only last night of the sea larvae and all jelly-fish!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;<i>Now</i> you have me! And all that I knew and had in mind a year after
			I left London&mdash;six years ago. But I kept it to myself. I had to do my work
			under frightful disadvantages. Oliver, my professor, was a scientific bounder,
			a journalist by instinct, a thief of ideas&mdash;he was always prying! And you
			know the knavish system of the scientific world. I simply would not publish,
			and let him share my credit. I went on working; I got nearer and nearer making
			my formula into an experiment, a reality. I told no living soul, because I
			meant to flash my work upon the world with crushing effect and become famous at
			a blow. I took up the question of pigments to fill up certain gaps. And
			suddenly, not by design but by accident, I made a discovery in
			physiology.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You know the red colouring matter of blood; it can be made
			white&mdash;colourless&mdash;and remain with all the functions it has
			now!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp gave a cry of incredulous amazement.
		</p>

		<p>
			The Invisible Man rose and began pacing the little study. &ldquo;You may well
			exclaim. I remember that night. It was late at night&mdash;in the daytime one
			was bothered with the gaping, silly students&mdash;and I worked then sometimes
			till dawn. It came suddenly, splendid and complete in my mind. I was alone; the
			laboratory was still, with the tall lights burning brightly and silently. In
			all my great moments I have been alone. &lsquo;One could make an animal&mdash;a
			tissue&mdash;transparent! One could make it invisible! All except the
			pigments&mdash;I could be invisible!&rsquo; I said, suddenly realising what it
			meant to be an albino with such knowledge. It was overwhelming. I left the
			filtering I was doing, and went and stared out of the great window at the
			stars. &lsquo;I could be invisible!&rsquo; I repeated.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;To do such a thing would be to transcend magic. And I beheld, unclouded
			by doubt, a magnificent vision of all that invisibility might mean to a
			man&mdash;the mystery, the power, the freedom. Drawbacks I saw none. You have
			only to think! And I, a shabby, poverty-struck, hemmed-in demonstrator,
			teaching fools in a provincial college, might suddenly become&mdash;this. I ask
			you, Kemp if <i>you</i> ... Anyone, I tell you, would have flung himself upon
			that research. And I worked three years, and every mountain of difficulty I
			toiled over showed another from its summit. The infinite details! And the
			exasperation! A professor, a provincial professor, always prying. &lsquo;When
			are you going to publish this work of yours?&rsquo; was his everlasting
			question. And the students, the cramped means! Three years I had of it&mdash;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;And after three years of secrecy and exasperation, I found that to
			complete it was impossible&mdash;impossible.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Kemp.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Money,&rdquo; said the Invisible Man, and went again to stare out of the
			window.
		</p>

		<p>
			He turned around abruptly. &ldquo;I robbed the old man&mdash;robbed my father.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;The money was not his, and he shot himself.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<h2><a name="chap20"></a>CHAPTER XX.<br />
			AT THE HOUSE IN GREAT PORTLAND STREET</h2>

		<p>
			For a moment Kemp sat in silence, staring at the back of the headless figure at
			the window. Then he started, struck by a thought, rose, took the Invisible
			Man&rsquo;s arm, and turned him away from the outlook.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You are tired,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and while I sit, you walk about.
			Have my chair.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He placed himself between Griffin and the nearest window.
		</p>

		<p>
			For a space Griffin sat silent, and then he resumed abruptly:
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I had left the Chesilstowe cottage already,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when
			that happened. It was last December. I had taken a room in London, a large
			unfurnished room in a big ill-managed lodging-house in a slum near Great
			Portland Street. The room was soon full of the appliances I had bought with his
			money; the work was going on steadily, successfully, drawing near an end. I was
			like a man emerging from a thicket, and suddenly coming on some unmeaning
			tragedy. I went to bury him. My mind was still on this research, and I did not
			lift a finger to save his character. I remember the funeral, the cheap hearse,
			the scant ceremony, the windy frost-bitten hillside, and the old college friend
			of his who read the service over him&mdash;a shabby, black, bent old man with a
			snivelling cold.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I remember walking back to the empty house, through the place that had
			once been a village and was now patched and tinkered by the jerry builders into
			the ugly likeness of a town. Every way the roads ran out at last into the
			desecrated fields and ended in rubble heaps and rank wet weeds. I remember
			myself as a gaunt black figure, going along the slippery, shiny pavement, and
			the strange sense of detachment I felt from the squalid respectability, the
			sordid commercialism of the place.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I did not feel a bit sorry for my father. He seemed to me to be the
			victim of his own foolish sentimentality. The current cant required my
			attendance at his funeral, but it was really not my affair.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But going along the High Street, my old life came back to me for a
			space, for I met the girl I had known ten years since. Our eyes met.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Something moved me to turn back and talk to her. She was a very ordinary
			person.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It was all like a dream, that visit to the old places. I did not feel
			then that I was lonely, that I had come out from the world into a desolate
			place. I appreciated my loss of sympathy, but I put it down to the general
			inanity of things. Re-entering my room seemed like the recovery of reality.
			There were the things I knew and loved. There stood the apparatus, the
			experiments arranged and waiting. And now there was scarcely a difficulty left,
			beyond the planning of details.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I will tell you, Kemp, sooner or later, all the complicated processes.
			We need not go into that now. For the most part, saving certain gaps I chose to
			remember, they are written in cypher in those books that tramp has hidden. We
			must hunt him down. We must get those books again. But the essential phase was
			to place the transparent object whose refractive index was to be lowered
			between two radiating centres of a sort of ethereal vibration, of which I will
			tell you more fully later. No, not those R&ouml;ntgen vibrations&mdash;I
			don&rsquo;t know that these others of mine have been described. Yet they are
			obvious enough. I needed two little dynamos, and these I worked with a cheap
			gas engine. My first experiment was with a bit of white wool fabric. It was the
			strangest thing in the world to see it in the flicker of the flashes soft and
			white, and then to watch it fade like a wreath of smoke and vanish.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I could scarcely believe I had done it. I put my hand into the
			emptiness, and there was the thing as solid as ever. I felt it awkwardly, and
			threw it on the floor. I had a little trouble finding it again.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;And then came a curious experience. I heard a miaow behind me, and
			turning, saw a lean white cat, very dirty, on the cistern cover outside the
			window. A thought came into my head. &lsquo;Everything ready for you,&rsquo; I
			said, and went to the window, opened it, and called softly. She came in,
			purring&mdash;the poor beast was starving&mdash;and I gave her some milk. All
			my food was in a cupboard in the corner of the room. After that she went
			smelling round the room, evidently with the idea of making herself at home. The
			invisible rag upset her a bit; you should have seen her spit at it! But I made
			her comfortable on the pillow of my truckle-bed. And I gave her butter to get
			her to wash.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;And you processed her?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I processed her. But giving drugs to a cat is no joke, Kemp! And the
			process failed.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Failed!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;In two particulars. These were the claws and the pigment stuff, what is
			it?&mdash;at the back of the eye in a cat. You know?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;<i>Tapetum</i>.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Yes, the <i>tapetum</i>. It didn&rsquo;t go. After I&rsquo;d given the
			stuff to bleach the blood and done certain other things to her, I gave the
			beast opium, and put her and the pillow she was sleeping on, on the apparatus.
			And after all the rest had faded and vanished, there remained two little ghosts
			of her eyes.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Odd!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain it. She was bandaged and clamped, of
			course&mdash;so I had her safe; but she woke while she was still misty, and
			miaowed dismally, and someone came knocking. It was an old woman from
			downstairs, who suspected me of vivisecting&mdash;a drink-sodden old creature,
			with only a white cat to care for in all the world. I whipped out some
			chloroform, applied it, and answered the door. &lsquo;Did I hear a cat?&rsquo;
			she asked. &lsquo;My cat?&rsquo; &lsquo;Not here,&rsquo; said I, very politely.
			She was a little doubtful and tried to peer past me into the room; strange
			enough to her no doubt&mdash;bare walls, uncurtained windows, truckle-bed, with
			the gas engine vibrating, and the seethe of the radiant points, and that faint
			ghastly stinging of chloroform in the air. She had to be satisfied at last and
			went away again.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;How long did it take?&rdquo; asked Kemp.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Three or four hours&mdash;the cat. The bones and sinews and the fat were
			the last to go, and the tips of the coloured hairs. And, as I say, the back
			part of the eye, tough, iridescent stuff it is, wouldn&rsquo;t go at all.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It was night outside long before the business was over, and nothing was
			to be seen but the dim eyes and the claws. I stopped the gas engine, felt for
			and stroked the beast, which was still insensible, and then, being tired, left
			it sleeping on the invisible pillow and went to bed. I found it hard to sleep.
			I lay awake thinking weak aimless stuff, going over the experiment over and
			over again, or dreaming feverishly of things growing misty and vanishing about
			me, until everything, the ground I stood on, vanished, and so I came to that
			sickly falling nightmare one gets. About two, the cat began miaowing about the
			room. I tried to hush it by talking to it, and then I decided to turn it out. I
			remember the shock I had when striking a light&mdash;there were just the round
			eyes shining green&mdash;and nothing round them. I would have given it milk,
			but I hadn&rsquo;t any. It wouldn&rsquo;t be quiet, it just sat down and
			miaowed at the door. I tried to catch it, with an idea of putting it out of the
			window, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be caught, it vanished. Then it began miaowing in
			different parts of the room. At last I opened the window and made a bustle. I
			suppose it went out at last. I never saw any more of it.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Then&mdash;Heaven knows why&mdash;I fell thinking of my father&rsquo;s
			funeral again, and the dismal windy hillside, until the day had come. I found
			sleeping was hopeless, and, locking my door after me, wandered out into the
			morning streets.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say there&rsquo;s an invisible cat at
			large!&rdquo; said Kemp.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;If it hasn&rsquo;t been killed,&rdquo; said the Invisible Man.
			&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Kemp. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to
			interrupt.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very probably been killed,&rdquo; said the Invisible Man.
			&ldquo;It was alive four days after, I know, and down a grating in Great
			Titchfield Street; because I saw a crowd round the place, trying to see whence
			the miaowing came.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He was silent for the best part of a minute. Then he resumed abruptly:
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I remember that morning before the change very vividly. I must have gone
			up Great Portland Street. I remember the barracks in Albany Street, and the
			horse soldiers coming out, and at last I found the summit of Primrose Hill. It
			was a sunny day in January&mdash;one of those sunny, frosty days that came
			before the snow this year. My weary brain tried to formulate the position, to
			plot out a plan of action.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I was surprised to find, now that my prize was within my grasp, how
			inconclusive its attainment seemed. As a matter of fact I was worked out; the
			intense stress of nearly four years&rsquo; continuous work left me incapable of
			any strength of feeling. I was apathetic, and I tried in vain to recover the
			enthusiasm of my first inquiries, the passion of discovery that had enabled me
			to compass even the downfall of my father&rsquo;s grey hairs. Nothing seemed to
			matter. I saw pretty clearly this was a transient mood, due to overwork and
			want of sleep, and that either by drugs or rest it would be possible to recover
			my energies.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;All I could think clearly was that the thing had to be carried through;
			the fixed idea still ruled me. And soon, for the money I had was almost
			exhausted. I looked about me at the hillside, with children playing and girls
			watching them, and tried to think of all the fantastic advantages an invisible
			man would have in the world. After a time I crawled home, took some food and a
			strong dose of strychnine, and went to sleep in my clothes on my unmade bed.
			Strychnine is a grand tonic, Kemp, to take the flabbiness out of a man.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the devil,&rdquo; said Kemp. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
			palaeolithic in a bottle.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I awoke vastly invigorated and rather irritable. You know?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I know the stuff.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;And there was someone rapping at the door. It was my landlord with
			threats and inquiries, an old Polish Jew in a long grey coat and greasy
			slippers. I had been tormenting a cat in the night, he was sure&mdash;the old
			woman&rsquo;s tongue had been busy. He insisted on knowing all about it. The
			laws in this country against vivisection were very severe&mdash;he might be
			liable. I denied the cat. Then the vibration of the little gas engine could be
			felt all over the house, he said. That was true, certainly. He edged round me
			into the room, peering about over his German-silver spectacles, and a sudden
			dread came into my mind that he might carry away something of my secret. I
			tried to keep between him and the concentrating apparatus I had arranged, and
			that only made him more curious. What was I doing? Why was I always alone and
			secretive? Was it legal? Was it dangerous? I paid nothing but the usual rent.
			His had always been a most respectable house&mdash;in a disreputable
			neighbourhood. Suddenly my temper gave way. I told him to get out. He began to
			protest, to jabber of his right of entry. In a moment I had him by the collar;
			something ripped, and he went spinning out into his own passage. I slammed and
			locked the door and sat down quivering.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;He made a fuss outside, which I disregarded, and after a time he went
			away.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But this brought matters to a crisis. I did not know what he would do,
			nor even what he had the power to do. To move to fresh apartments would have
			meant delay; altogether I had barely twenty pounds left in the world, for the
			most part in a bank&mdash;and I could not afford that. Vanish! It was
			irresistible. Then there would be an inquiry, the sacking of my room.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;At the thought of the possibility of my work being exposed or
			interrupted at its very climax, I became very angry and active. I hurried out
			with my three books of notes, my cheque-book&mdash;the tramp has them
			now&mdash;and directed them from the nearest Post Office to a house of call for
			letters and parcels in Great Portland Street. I tried to go out noiselessly.
			Coming in, I found my landlord going quietly upstairs; he had heard the door
			close, I suppose. You would have laughed to see him jump aside on the landing
			as I came tearing after him. He glared at me as I went by him, and I made the
			house quiver with the slamming of my door. I heard him come shuffling up to my
			floor, hesitate, and go down. I set to work upon my preparations forthwith.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It was all done that evening and night. While I was still sitting under
			the sickly, drowsy influence of the drugs that decolourise blood, there came a
			repeated knocking at the door. It ceased, footsteps went away and returned, and
			the knocking was resumed. There was an attempt to push something under the
			door&mdash;a blue paper. Then in a fit of irritation I rose and went and flung
			the door wide open. &lsquo;Now then?&rsquo; said I.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It was my landlord, with a notice of ejectment or something. He held it
			out to me, saw something odd about my hands, I expect, and lifted his eyes to
			my face.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;For a moment he gaped. Then he gave a sort of inarticulate cry, dropped
			candle and writ together, and went blundering down the dark passage to the
			stairs. I shut the door, locked it, and went to the looking-glass. Then I
			understood his terror.... My face was white&mdash;like white stone.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But it was all horrible. I had not expected the suffering. A night of
			racking anguish, sickness and fainting. I set my teeth, though my skin was
			presently afire, all my body afire; but I lay there like grim death. I
			understood now how it was the cat had howled until I chloroformed it. Lucky it
			was I lived alone and untended in my room. There were times when I sobbed and
			groaned and talked. But I stuck to it.... I became insensible and woke languid
			in the darkness.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;The pain had passed. I thought I was killing myself and I did not care.
			I shall never forget that dawn, and the strange horror of seeing that my hands
			had become as clouded glass, and watching them grow clearer and thinner as the
			day went by, until at last I could see the sickly disorder of my room through
			them, though I closed my transparent eyelids. My limbs became glassy, the bones
			and arteries faded, vanished, and the little white nerves went last. I gritted
			my teeth and stayed there to the end. At last only the dead tips of the
			fingernails remained, pallid and white, and the brown stain of some acid upon
			my fingers.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I struggled up. At first I was as incapable as a swathed
			infant&mdash;stepping with limbs I could not see. I was weak and very hungry. I
			went and stared at nothing in my shaving-glass, at nothing save where an
			attenuated pigment still remained behind the retina of my eyes, fainter than
			mist. I had to hang on to the table and press my forehead against the glass.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It was only by a frantic effort of will that I dragged myself back to
			the apparatus and completed the process.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I slept during the forenoon, pulling the sheet over my eyes to shut out
			the light, and about midday I was awakened again by a knocking. My strength had
			returned. I sat up and listened and heard a whispering. I sprang to my feet and
			as noiselessly as possible began to detach the connections of my apparatus, and
			to distribute it about the room, so as to destroy the suggestions of its
			arrangement. Presently the knocking was renewed and voices called, first my
			landlord&rsquo;s, and then two others. To gain time I answered them. The
			invisible rag and pillow came to hand and I opened the window and pitched them
			out on to the cistern cover. As the window opened, a heavy crash came at the
			door. Someone had charged it with the idea of smashing the lock. But the stout
			bolts I had screwed up some days before stopped him. That startled me, made me
			angry. I began to tremble and do things hurriedly.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I tossed together some loose paper, straw, packing paper and so forth,
			in the middle of the room, and turned on the gas. Heavy blows began to rain
			upon the door. I could not find the matches. I beat my hands on the wall with
			rage. I turned down the gas again, stepped out of the window on the cistern
			cover, very softly lowered the sash, and sat down, secure and invisible, but
			quivering with anger, to watch events. They split a panel, I saw, and in
			another moment they had broken away the staples of the bolts and stood in the
			open doorway. It was the landlord and his two step-sons, sturdy young men of
			three or four and twenty. Behind them fluttered the old hag of a woman from
			downstairs.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You may imagine their astonishment to find the room empty. One of the
			younger men rushed to the window at once, flung it up and stared out. His
			staring eyes and thick-lipped bearded face came a foot from my face. I was half
			minded to hit his silly countenance, but I arrested my doubled fist. He stared
			right through me. So did the others as they joined him. The old man went and
			peered under the bed, and then they all made a rush for the cupboard. They had
			to argue about it at length in Yiddish and Cockney English. They concluded I
			had not answered them, that their imagination had deceived them. A feeling of
			extraordinary elation took the place of my anger as I sat outside the window
			and watched these four people&mdash;for the old lady came in, glancing
			suspiciously about her like a cat, trying to understand the riddle of my
			behaviour.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;The old man, so far as I could understand his <i>patois</i>, agreed with
			the old lady that I was a vivisectionist. The sons protested in garbled English
			that I was an electrician, and appealed to the dynamos and radiators. They were
			all nervous about my arrival, although I found subsequently that they had
			bolted the front door. The old lady peered into the cupboard and under the bed,
			and one of the young men pushed up the register and stared up the chimney. One
			of my fellow lodgers, a coster-monger who shared the opposite room with a
			butcher, appeared on the landing, and he was called in and told incoherent
			things.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It occurred to me that the radiators, if they fell into the hands of
			some acute well-educated person, would give me away too much, and watching my
			opportunity, I came into the room and tilted one of the little dynamos off its
			fellow on which it was standing, and smashed both apparatus. Then, while they
			were trying to explain the smash, I dodged out of the room and went softly
			downstairs.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I went into one of the sitting-rooms and waited until they came down,
			still speculating and argumentative, all a little disappointed at finding no
			&lsquo;horrors,&rsquo; and all a little puzzled how they stood legally towards
			me. Then I slipped up again with a box of matches, fired my heap of paper and
			rubbish, put the chairs and bedding thereby, led the gas to the affair, by
			means of an india-rubber tube, and waving a farewell to the room left it for
			the last time.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You fired the house!&rdquo; exclaimed Kemp.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Fired the house. It was the only way to cover my trail&mdash;and no
			doubt it was insured. I slipped the bolts of the front door quietly and went
			out into the street. I was invisible, and I was only just beginning to realise
			the extraordinary advantage my invisibility gave me. My head was already
			teeming with plans of all the wild and wonderful things I had now impunity to
			do.&rdquo;

		<h2><a name="chap21"></a>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
			IN OXFORD STREET</h2>

		<p>
			&ldquo;In going downstairs the first time I found an unexpected difficulty
			because I could not see my feet; indeed I stumbled twice, and there was an
			unaccustomed clumsiness in gripping the bolt. By not looking down, however, I
			managed to walk on the level passably well.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;My mood, I say, was one of exaltation. I felt as a seeing man might do,
			with padded feet and noiseless clothes, in a city of the blind. I experienced a
			wild impulse to jest, to startle people, to clap men on the back, fling
			people&rsquo;s hats astray, and generally revel in my extraordinary advantage.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But hardly had I emerged upon Great Portland Street, however (my lodging
			was close to the big draper&rsquo;s shop there), when I heard a clashing
			concussion and was hit violently behind, and turning saw a man carrying a
			basket of soda-water syphons, and looking in amazement at his burden. Although
			the blow had really hurt me, I found something so irresistible in his
			astonishment that I laughed aloud. &lsquo;The devil&rsquo;s in the
			basket,&rsquo; I said, and suddenly twisted it out of his hand. He let go
			incontinently, and I swung the whole weight into the air.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But a fool of a cabman, standing outside a public house, made a sudden
			rush for this, and his extending fingers took me with excruciating violence
			under the ear. I let the whole down with a smash on the cabman, and then, with
			shouts and the clatter of feet about me, people coming out of shops, vehicles
			pulling up, I realised what I had done for myself, and cursing my folly, backed
			against a shop window and prepared to dodge out of the confusion. In a moment I
			should be wedged into a crowd and inevitably discovered. I pushed by a butcher
			boy, who luckily did not turn to see the nothingness that shoved him aside, and
			dodged behind the cab-man&rsquo;s four-wheeler. I do not know how they settled
			the business. I hurried straight across the road, which was happily clear, and
			hardly heeding which way I went, in the fright of detection the incident had
			given me, plunged into the afternoon throng of Oxford Street.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I tried to get into the stream of people, but they were too thick for
			me, and in a moment my heels were being trodden upon. I took to the gutter, the
			roughness of which I found painful to my feet, and forthwith the shaft of a
			crawling hansom dug me forcibly under the shoulder blade, reminding me that I
			was already bruised severely. I staggered out of the way of the cab, avoided a
			perambulator by a convulsive movement, and found myself behind the hansom. A
			happy thought saved me, and as this drove slowly along I followed in its
			immediate wake, trembling and astonished at the turn of my adventure. And not
			only trembling, but shivering. It was a bright day in January and I was stark
			naked and the thin slime of mud that covered the road was freezing. Foolish as
			it seems to me now, I had not reckoned that, transparent or not, I was still
			amenable to the weather and all its consequences.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Then suddenly a bright idea came into my head. I ran round and got into
			the cab. And so, shivering, scared, and sniffing with the first intimations of
			a cold, and with the bruises in the small of my back growing upon my attention,
			I drove slowly along Oxford Street and past Tottenham Court Road. My mood was
			as different from that in which I had sallied forth ten minutes ago as it is
			possible to imagine. This invisibility indeed! The one thought that possessed
			me was&mdash;how was I to get out of the scrape I was in.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;We crawled past Mudie&rsquo;s, and there a tall woman with five or six
			yellow-labelled books hailed my cab, and I sprang out just in time to escape
			her, shaving a railway van narrowly in my flight. I made off up the roadway to
			Bloomsbury Square, intending to strike north past the Museum and so get into
			the quiet district. I was now cruelly chilled, and the strangeness of my
			situation so unnerved me that I whimpered as I ran. At the northward corner of
			the Square a little white dog ran out of the Pharmaceutical Society&rsquo;s
			offices, and incontinently made for me, nose down.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I had never realised it before, but the nose is to the mind of a dog
			what the eye is to the mind of a seeing man. Dogs perceive the scent of a man
			moving as men perceive his vision. This brute began barking and leaping,
			showing, as it seemed to me, only too plainly that he was aware of me. I
			crossed Great Russell Street, glancing over my shoulder as I did so, and went
			some way along Montague Street before I realised what I was running towards.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Then I became aware of a blare of music, and looking along the street
			saw a number of people advancing out of Russell Square, red shirts, and the
			banner of the Salvation Army to the fore. Such a crowd, chanting in the roadway
			and scoffing on the pavement, I could not hope to penetrate, and dreading to go
			back and farther from home again, and deciding on the spur of the moment, I ran
			up the white steps of a house facing the museum railings, and stood there until
			the crowd should have passed. Happily the dog stopped at the noise of the band
			too, hesitated, and turned tail, running back to Bloomsbury Square again.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;On came the band, bawling with unconscious irony some hymn about
			&lsquo;When shall we see His face?&rsquo; and it seemed an interminable time to
			me before the tide of the crowd washed along the pavement by me. Thud, thud,
			thud, came the drum with a vibrating resonance, and for the moment I did not
			notice two urchins stopping at the railings by me. &lsquo;See &rsquo;em,&rsquo;
			said one. &lsquo;See what?&rsquo; said the other. &lsquo;Why&mdash;them
			footmarks&mdash;bare. Like what you makes in mud.&rsquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I looked down and saw the youngsters had stopped and were gaping at the
			muddy footmarks I had left behind me up the newly whitened steps. The passing
			people elbowed and jostled them, but their confounded intelligence was
			arrested. &lsquo;Thud, thud, thud, when, thud, shall we see, thud, his face,
			thud, thud.&rsquo; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a barefoot man gone up them steps, or I
			don&rsquo;t know nothing,&rsquo; said one. &lsquo;And he ain&rsquo;t never come
			down again. And his foot was a-bleeding.&rsquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;The thick of the crowd had already passed. &lsquo;Looky there,
			Ted,&rsquo; quoth the younger of the detectives, with the sharpness of surprise
			in his voice, and pointed straight to my feet. I looked down and saw at once
			the dim suggestion of their outline sketched in splashes of mud. For a moment I
			was paralysed.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, that&rsquo;s rum,&rsquo; said the elder. &lsquo;Dashed rum!
			It&rsquo;s just like the ghost of a foot, ain&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; He hesitated
			and advanced with outstretched hand. A man pulled up short to see what he was
			catching, and then a girl. In another moment he would have touched me. Then I
			saw what to do. I made a step, the boy started back with an exclamation, and
			with a rapid movement I swung myself over into the portico of the next house.
			But the smaller boy was sharp-eyed enough to follow the movement, and before I
			was well down the steps and upon the pavement, he had recovered from his
			momentary astonishment and was shouting out that the feet had gone over the
			wall.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;They rushed round and saw my new footmarks flash into being on the lower
			step and upon the pavement. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rsquo; asked someone.
			&lsquo;Feet! Look! Feet running!&rsquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Everybody in the road, except my three pursuers, was pouring along after
			the Salvation Army, and this blow not only impeded me but them. There was an
			eddy of surprise and interrogation. At the cost of bowling over one young
			fellow I got through, and in another moment I was rushing headlong round the
			circuit of Russell Square, with six or seven astonished people following my
			footmarks. There was no time for explanation, or else the whole host would have
			been after me.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Twice I doubled round corners, thrice I crossed the road and came back
			upon my tracks, and then, as my feet grew hot and dry, the damp impressions
			began to fade. At last I had a breathing space and rubbed my feet clean with my
			hands, and so got away altogether. The last I saw of the chase was a little
			group of a dozen people perhaps, studying with infinite perplexity a slowly
			drying footprint that had resulted from a puddle in Tavistock Square, a
			footprint as isolated and incomprehensible to them as Crusoe&rsquo;s solitary
			discovery.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;This running warmed me to a certain extent, and I went on with a better
			courage through the maze of less frequented roads that runs hereabouts. My back
			had now become very stiff and sore, my tonsils were painful from the
			cabman&rsquo;s fingers, and the skin of my neck had been scratched by his
			nails; my feet hurt exceedingly and I was lame from a little cut on one foot. I
			saw in time a blind man approaching me, and fled limping, for I feared his
			subtle intuitions. Once or twice accidental collisions occurred and I left
			people amazed, with unaccountable curses ringing in their ears. Then came
			something silent and quiet against my face, and across the Square fell a thin
			veil of slowly falling flakes of snow. I had caught a cold, and do as I would I
			could not avoid an occasional sneeze. And every dog that came in sight, with
			its pointing nose and curious sniffing, was a terror to me.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Then came men and boys running, first one and then others, and shouting
			as they ran. It was a fire. They ran in the direction of my lodging, and
			looking back down a street I saw a mass of black smoke streaming up above the
			roofs and telephone wires. It was my lodging burning; my clothes, my apparatus,
			all my resources indeed, except my cheque-book and the three volumes of
			memoranda that awaited me in Great Portland Street, were there. Burning! I had
			burnt my boats&mdash;if ever a man did! The place was blazing.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			The Invisible Man paused and thought. Kemp glanced nervously out of the window.
			&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<h2><a name="chap22"></a>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
			IN THE EMPORIUM</h2>

		<p>
			&ldquo;So last January, with the beginning of a snowstorm in the air about
			me&mdash;and if it settled on me it would betray me!&mdash;weary, cold,
			painful, inexpressibly wretched, and still but half convinced of my invisible
			quality, I began this new life to which I am committed. I had no refuge, no
			appliances, no human being in the world in whom I could confide. To have told
			my secret would have given me away&mdash;made a mere show and rarity of me.
			Nevertheless, I was half-minded to accost some passer-by and throw myself upon
			his mercy. But I knew too clearly the terror and brutal cruelty my advances
			would evoke. I made no plans in the street. My sole object was to get shelter
			from the snow, to get myself covered and warm; then I might hope to plan. But
			even to me, an Invisible Man, the rows of London houses stood latched, barred,
			and bolted impregnably.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Only one thing could I see clearly before me&mdash;the cold exposure and
			misery of the snowstorm and the night.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;And then I had a brilliant idea. I turned down one of the roads leading
			from Gower Street to Tottenham Court Road, and found myself outside Omniums,
			the big establishment where everything is to be bought&mdash;you know the
			place: meat, grocery, linen, furniture, clothing, oil paintings even&mdash;a
			huge meandering collection of shops rather than a shop. I had thought I should
			find the doors open, but they were closed, and as I stood in the wide entrance
			a carriage stopped outside, and a man in uniform&mdash;you know the kind of
			personage with &lsquo;Omnium&rsquo; on his cap&mdash;flung open the door. I
			contrived to enter, and walking down the shop&mdash;it was a department where
			they were selling ribbons and gloves and stockings and that kind of
			thing&mdash;came to a more spacious region devoted to picnic baskets and wicker
			furniture.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I did not feel safe there, however; people were going to and fro, and I
			prowled restlessly about until I came upon a huge section in an upper floor
			containing multitudes of bedsteads, and over these I clambered, and found a
			resting-place at last among a huge pile of folded flock mattresses. The place
			was already lit up and agreeably warm, and I decided to remain where I was,
			keeping a cautious eye on the two or three sets of shopmen and customers who
			were meandering through the place, until closing time came. Then I should be
			able, I thought, to rob the place for food and clothing, and disguised, prowl
			through it and examine its resources, perhaps sleep on some of the bedding.
			That seemed an acceptable plan. My idea was to procure clothing to make myself
			a muffled but acceptable figure, to get money, and then to recover my books and
			parcels where they awaited me, take a lodging somewhere and elaborate plans for
			the complete realisation of the advantages my invisibility gave me (as I still
			imagined) over my fellow-men.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Closing time arrived quickly enough. It could not have been more than an
			hour after I took up my position on the mattresses before I noticed the blinds
			of the windows being drawn, and customers being marched doorward. And then a
			number of brisk young men began with remarkable alacrity to tidy up the goods
			that remained disturbed. I left my lair as the crowds diminished, and prowled
			cautiously out into the less desolate parts of the shop. I was really surprised
			to observe how rapidly the young men and women whipped away the goods displayed
			for sale during the day. All the boxes of goods, the hanging fabrics, the
			festoons of lace, the boxes of sweets in the grocery section, the displays of
			this and that, were being whipped down, folded up, slapped into tidy
			receptacles, and everything that could not be taken down and put away had
			sheets of some coarse stuff like sacking flung over them. Finally all the
			chairs were turned up on to the counters, leaving the floor clear. Directly
			each of these young people had done, he or she made promptly for the door with
			such an expression of animation as I have rarely observed in a shop assistant
			before. Then came a lot of youngsters scattering sawdust and carrying pails and
			brooms. I had to dodge to get out of the way, and as it was, my ankle got stung
			with the sawdust. For some time, wandering through the swathed and darkened
			departments, I could hear the brooms at work. And at last a good hour or more
			after the shop had been closed, came a noise of locking doors. Silence came
			upon the place, and I found myself wandering through the vast and intricate
			shops, galleries, show-rooms of the place, alone. It was very still; in one
			place I remember passing near one of the Tottenham Court Road entrances and
			listening to the tapping of boot-heels of the passers-by.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;My first visit was to the place where I had seen stockings and gloves
			for sale. It was dark, and I had the devil of a hunt after matches, which I
			found at last in the drawer of the little cash desk. Then I had to get a
			candle. I had to tear down wrappings and ransack a number of boxes and drawers,
			but at last I managed to turn out what I sought; the box label called them
			lambswool pants, and lambswool vests. Then socks, a thick comforter, and then I
			went to the clothing place and got trousers, a lounge jacket, an overcoat and a
			slouch hat&mdash;a clerical sort of hat with the brim turned down. I began to
			feel a human being again, and my next thought was food.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Upstairs was a refreshment department, and there I got cold meat. There
			was coffee still in the urn, and I lit the gas and warmed it up again, and
			altogether I did not do badly. Afterwards, prowling through the place in search
			of blankets&mdash;I had to put up at last with a heap of down quilts&mdash;I
			came upon a grocery section with a lot of chocolate and candied fruits, more
			than was good for me indeed&mdash;and some white burgundy. And near that was a
			toy department, and I had a brilliant idea. I found some artificial
			noses&mdash;dummy noses, you know, and I thought of dark spectacles. But
			Omniums had no optical department. My nose had been a difficulty indeed&mdash;I
			had thought of paint. But the discovery set my mind running on wigs and masks
			and the like. Finally I went to sleep in a heap of down quilts, very warm and
			comfortable.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;My last thoughts before sleeping were the most agreeable I had had since
			the change. I was in a state of physical serenity, and that was reflected in my
			mind. I thought that I should be able to slip out unobserved in the morning
			with my clothes upon me, muffling my face with a white wrapper I had taken,
			purchase, with the money I had taken, spectacles and so forth, and so complete
			my disguise. I lapsed into disorderly dreams of all the fantastic things that
			had happened during the last few days. I saw the ugly little Jew of a landlord
			vociferating in his rooms; I saw his two sons marvelling, and the wrinkled old
			woman&rsquo;s gnarled face as she asked for her cat. I experienced again the
			strange sensation of seeing the cloth disappear, and so I came round to the
			windy hillside and the sniffing old clergyman mumbling &lsquo;Earth to earth,
			ashes to ashes, dust to dust,&rsquo; at my father&rsquo;s open grave.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;&lsquo;You also,&rsquo; said a voice, and suddenly I was being forced
			towards the grave. I struggled, shouted, appealed to the mourners, but they
			continued stonily following the service; the old clergyman, too, never faltered
			droning and sniffing through the ritual. I realised I was invisible and
			inaudible, that overwhelming forces had their grip on me. I struggled in vain,
			I was forced over the brink, the coffin rang hollow as I fell upon it, and the
			gravel came flying after me in spadefuls. Nobody heeded me, nobody was aware of
			me. I made convulsive struggles and awoke.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;The pale London dawn had come, the place was full of a chilly grey light
			that filtered round the edges of the window blinds. I sat up, and for a time I
			could not think where this ample apartment, with its counters, its piles of
			rolled stuff, its heap of quilts and cushions, its iron pillars, might be.
			Then, as recollection came back to me, I heard voices in conversation.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Then far down the place, in the brighter light of some department which
			had already raised its blinds, I saw two men approaching. I scrambled to my
			feet, looking about me for some way of escape, and even as I did so the sound
			of my movement made them aware of me. I suppose they saw merely a figure moving
			quietly and quickly away. &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; cried one, and
			&lsquo;Stop there!&rsquo; shouted the other. I dashed around a corner and came
			full tilt&mdash;a faceless figure, mind you!&mdash;on a lanky lad of fifteen.
			He yelled and I bowled him over, rushed past him, turned another corner, and by
			a happy inspiration threw myself behind a counter. In another moment feet went
			running past and I heard voices shouting, &lsquo;All hands to the doors!&rsquo;
			asking what was &lsquo;up,&rsquo; and giving one another advice how to catch
			me.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Lying on the ground, I felt scared out of my wits. But&mdash;odd as it
			may seem&mdash;it did not occur to me at the moment to take off my clothes as I
			should have done. I had made up my mind, I suppose, to get away in them, and
			that ruled me. And then down the vista of the counters came a bawling of
			&lsquo;Here he is!&rsquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I sprang to my feet, whipped a chair off the counter, and sent it
			whirling at the fool who had shouted, turned, came into another round a corner,
			sent him spinning, and rushed up the stairs. He kept his footing, gave a view
			hallo, and came up the staircase hot after me. Up the staircase were piled a
			multitude of those bright-coloured pot things&mdash;what are they?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Art pots,&rdquo; suggested Kemp.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! Art pots. Well, I turned at the top step and swung
			round, plucked one out of a pile and smashed it on his silly head as he came at
			me. The whole pile of pots went headlong, and I heard shouting and footsteps
			running from all parts. I made a mad rush for the refreshment place, and there
			was a man in white like a man cook, who took up the chase. I made one last
			desperate turn and found myself among lamps and ironmongery. I went behind the
			counter of this, and waited for my cook, and as he bolted in at the head of the
			chase, I doubled him up with a lamp. Down he went, and I crouched down behind
			the counter and began whipping off my clothes as fast as I could. Coat, jacket,
			trousers, shoes were all right, but a lambswool vest fits a man like a skin. I
			heard more men coming, my cook was lying quiet on the other side of the
			counter, stunned or scared speechless, and I had to make another dash for it,
			like a rabbit hunted out of a wood-pile.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;&lsquo;This way, policeman!&rsquo; I heard someone shouting. I found
			myself in my bedstead storeroom again, and at the end of a wilderness of
			wardrobes. I rushed among them, went flat, got rid of my vest after infinite
			wriggling, and stood a free man again, panting and scared, as the policeman and
			three of the shopmen came round the corner. They made a rush for the vest and
			pants, and collared the trousers. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s dropping his
			plunder,&rsquo; said one of the young men. &lsquo;He <i>must</i> be somewhere
			here.&rsquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But they did not find me all the same.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I stood watching them hunt for me for a time, and cursing my ill-luck in
			losing the clothes. Then I went into the refreshment-room, drank a little milk
			I found there, and sat down by the fire to consider my position.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;In a little while two assistants came in and began to talk over the
			business very excitedly and like the fools they were. I heard a magnified
			account of my depredations, and other speculations as to my whereabouts. Then I
			fell to scheming again. The insurmountable difficulty of the place, especially
			now it was alarmed, was to get any plunder out of it. I went down into the
			warehouse to see if there was any chance of packing and addressing a parcel,
			but I could not understand the system of checking. About eleven o&rsquo;clock,
			the snow having thawed as it fell, and the day being finer and a little warmer
			than the previous one, I decided that the Emporium was hopeless, and went out
			again, exasperated at my want of success, with only the vaguest plans of action
			in my mind.&rdquo;

		<h2><a name="chap23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
			IN DRURY LANE</h2>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But you begin now to realise,&rdquo; said the Invisible Man, &ldquo;the
			full disadvantage of my condition. I had no shelter&mdash;no covering&mdash;to
			get clothing was to forego all my advantage, to make myself a strange and
			terrible thing. I was fasting; for to eat, to fill myself with unassimilated
			matter, would be to become grotesquely visible again.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I never thought of that,&rdquo; said Kemp.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Nor had I. And the snow had warned me of other dangers. I could not go
			abroad in snow&mdash;it would settle on me and expose me. Rain, too, would make
			me a watery outline, a glistening surface of a man&mdash;a bubble. And
			fog&mdash;I should be like a fainter bubble in a fog, a surface, a greasy
			glimmer of humanity. Moreover, as I went abroad&mdash;in the London air&mdash;I
			gathered dirt about my ankles, floating smuts and dust upon my skin. I did not
			know how long it would be before I should become visible from that cause also.
			But I saw clearly it could not be for long.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Not in London at any rate.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I went into the slums towards Great Portland Street, and found myself at
			the end of the street in which I had lodged. I did not go that way, because of
			the crowd halfway down it opposite to the still smoking ruins of the house I
			had fired. My most immediate problem was to get clothing. What to do with my
			face puzzled me. Then I saw in one of those little miscellaneous
			shops&mdash;news, sweets, toys, stationery, belated Christmas tomfoolery, and
			so forth&mdash;an array of masks and noses. I realised that problem was solved.
			In a flash I saw my course. I turned about, no longer aimless, and
			went&mdash;circuitously in order to avoid the busy ways, towards the back
			streets north of the Strand; for I remembered, though not very distinctly
			where, that some theatrical costumiers had shops in that district.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;The day was cold, with a nipping wind down the northward running
			streets. I walked fast to avoid being overtaken. Every crossing was a danger,
			every passenger a thing to watch alertly. One man as I was about to pass him at
			the top of Bedford Street, turned upon me abruptly and came into me, sending me
			into the road and almost under the wheel of a passing hansom. The verdict of
			the cab-rank was that he had had some sort of stroke. I was so unnerved by this
			encounter that I went into Covent Garden Market and sat down for some time in a
			quiet corner by a stall of violets, panting and trembling. I found I had caught
			a fresh cold, and had to turn out after a time lest my sneezes should attract
			attention.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;At last I reached the object of my quest, a dirty, fly-blown little shop
			in a by-way near Drury Lane, with a window full of tinsel robes, sham jewels,
			wigs, slippers, dominoes and theatrical photographs. The shop was old-fashioned
			and low and dark, and the house rose above it for four storeys, dark and
			dismal. I peered through the window and, seeing no one within, entered. The
			opening of the door set a clanking bell ringing. I left it open, and walked
			round a bare costume stand, into a corner behind a cheval glass. For a minute
			or so no one came. Then I heard heavy feet striding across a room, and a man
			appeared down the shop.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;My plans were now perfectly definite. I proposed to make my way into the
			house, secrete myself upstairs, watch my opportunity, and when everything was
			quiet, rummage out a wig, mask, spectacles, and costume, and go into the world,
			perhaps a grotesque but still a credible figure. And incidentally of course I
			could rob the house of any available money.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;The man who had just entered the shop was a short, slight, hunched,
			beetle-browed man, with long arms and very short bandy legs. Apparently I had
			interrupted a meal. He stared about the shop with an expression of expectation.
			This gave way to surprise, and then to anger, as he saw the shop empty.
			&lsquo;Damn the boys!&rsquo; he said. He went to stare up and down the street.
			He came in again in a minute, kicked the door to with his foot spitefully, and
			went muttering back to the house door.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I came forward to follow him, and at the noise of my movement he stopped
			dead. I did so too, startled by his quickness of ear. He slammed the house door
			in my face.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I stood hesitating. Suddenly I heard his quick footsteps returning, and
			the door reopened. He stood looking about the shop like one who was still not
			satisfied. Then, murmuring to himself, he examined the back of the counter and
			peered behind some fixtures. Then he stood doubtful. He had left the house door
			open and I slipped into the inner room.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It was a queer little room, poorly furnished and with a number of big
			masks in the corner. On the table was his belated breakfast, and it was a
			confoundedly exasperating thing for me, Kemp, to have to sniff his coffee and
			stand watching while he came in and resumed his meal. And his table manners
			were irritating. Three doors opened into the little room, one going upstairs
			and one down, but they were all shut. I could not get out of the room while he
			was there; I could scarcely move because of his alertness, and there was a
			draught down my back. Twice I strangled a sneeze just in time.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;The spectacular quality of my sensations was curious and novel, but for
			all that I was heartily tired and angry long before he had done his eating. But
			at last he made an end and putting his beggarly crockery on the black tin tray
			upon which he had had his teapot, and gathering all the crumbs up on the
			mustard stained cloth, he took the whole lot of things after him. His burden
			prevented his shutting the door behind him&mdash;as he would have done; I never
			saw such a man for shutting doors&mdash;and I followed him into a very dirty
			underground kitchen and scullery. I had the pleasure of seeing him begin to
			wash up, and then, finding no good in keeping down there, and the brick floor
			being cold on my feet, I returned upstairs and sat in his chair by the fire. It
			was burning low, and scarcely thinking, I put on a little coal. The noise of
			this brought him up at once, and he stood aglare. He peered about the room and
			was within an ace of touching me. Even after that examination, he scarcely
			seemed satisfied. He stopped in the doorway and took a final inspection before
			he went down.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I waited in the little parlour for an age, and at last he came up and
			opened the upstairs door. I just managed to get by him.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;On the staircase he stopped suddenly, so that I very nearly blundered
			into him. He stood looking back right into my face and listening. &lsquo;I
			could have sworn,&rsquo; he said. His long hairy hand pulled at his lower lip.
			His eye went up and down the staircase. Then he grunted and went on up again.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;His hand was on the handle of a door, and then he stopped again with the
			same puzzled anger on his face. He was becoming aware of the faint sounds of my
			movements about him. The man must have had diabolically acute hearing. He
			suddenly flashed into rage. &lsquo;If there&rsquo;s anyone in this
			house&mdash;&rsquo; he cried with an oath, and left the threat unfinished. He
			put his hand in his pocket, failed to find what he wanted, and rushing past me
			went blundering noisily and pugnaciously downstairs. But I did not follow him.
			I sat on the head of the staircase until his return.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Presently he came up again, still muttering. He opened the door of the
			room, and before I could enter, slammed it in my face.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I resolved to explore the house, and spent some time in doing so as
			noiselessly as possible. The house was very old and tumble-down, damp so that
			the paper in the attics was peeling from the walls, and rat infested. Some of
			the door handles were stiff and I was afraid to turn them. Several rooms I did
			inspect were unfurnished, and others were littered with theatrical lumber,
			bought second-hand, I judged, from its appearance. In one room next to his I
			found a lot of old clothes. I began routing among these, and in my eagerness
			forgot again the evident sharpness of his ears. I heard a stealthy footstep
			and, looking up just in time, saw him peering in at the tumbled heap and
			holding an old-fashioned revolver in his hand. I stood perfectly still while he
			stared about open-mouthed and suspicious. &lsquo;It must have been her,&rsquo;
			he said slowly. &lsquo;Damn her!&rsquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;He shut the door quietly, and immediately I heard the key turn in the
			lock. Then his footsteps retreated. I realised abruptly that I was locked in.
			For a minute I did not know what to do. I walked from door to window and back,
			and stood perplexed. A gust of anger came upon me. But I decided to inspect the
			clothes before I did anything further, and my first attempt brought down a pile
			from an upper shelf. This brought him back, more sinister than ever. That time
			he actually touched me, jumped back with amazement and stood astonished in the
			middle of the room.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Presently he calmed a little. &lsquo;Rats,&rsquo; he said in an
			undertone, fingers on lips. He was evidently a little scared. I edged quietly
			out of the room, but a plank creaked. Then the infernal little brute started
			going all over the house, revolver in hand and locking door after door and
			pocketing the keys. When I realised what he was up to I had a fit of
			rage&mdash;I could hardly control myself sufficiently to watch my opportunity.
			By this time I knew he was alone in the house, and so I made no more ado, but
			knocked him on the head.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Knocked him on the head?&rdquo; exclaimed Kemp.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Yes&mdash;stunned him&mdash;as he was going downstairs. Hit him from
			behind with a stool that stood on the landing. He went downstairs like a bag of
			old boots.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But&mdash;I say! The common conventions of humanity&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Are all very well for common people. But the point was, Kemp, that I had
			to get out of that house in a disguise without his seeing me. I couldn&rsquo;t
			think of any other way of doing it. And then I gagged him with a Louis Quatorze
			vest and tied him up in a sheet.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Tied him up in a sheet!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Made a sort of bag of it. It was rather a good idea to keep the idiot
			scared and quiet, and a devilish hard thing to get out of&mdash;head away from
			the string. My dear Kemp, it&rsquo;s no good your sitting glaring as though I
			was a murderer. It had to be done. He had his revolver. If once he saw me he
			would be able to describe me&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But still,&rdquo; said Kemp, &ldquo;in England&mdash;to-day. And the man
			was in his own house, and you were&mdash;well, robbing.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Robbing! Confound it! You&rsquo;ll call me a thief next! Surely, Kemp,
			you&rsquo;re not fool enough to dance on the old strings. Can&rsquo;t you see
			my position?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;And his too,&rdquo; said Kemp.
		</p>

		<p>
			The Invisible Man stood up sharply. &ldquo;What do you mean to say?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp&rsquo;s face grew a trifle hard. He was about to speak and checked
			himself. &ldquo;I suppose, after all,&rdquo; he said with a sudden change of
			manner, &ldquo;the thing had to be done. You were in a fix. But
			still&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Of course I was in a fix&mdash;an infernal fix. And he made me wild
			too&mdash;hunting me about the house, fooling about with his revolver, locking
			and unlocking doors. He was simply exasperating. You don&rsquo;t blame me, do
			you? You don&rsquo;t blame me?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I never blame anyone,&rdquo; said Kemp. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite out of
			fashion. What did you do next?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I was hungry. Downstairs I found a loaf and some rank cheese&mdash;more
			than sufficient to satisfy my hunger. I took some brandy and water, and then
			went up past my impromptu bag&mdash;he was lying quite still&mdash;to the room
			containing the old clothes. This looked out upon the street, two lace curtains
			brown with dirt guarding the window. I went and peered out through their
			interstices. Outside the day was bright&mdash;by contrast with the brown
			shadows of the dismal house in which I found myself, dazzlingly bright. A brisk
			traffic was going by, fruit carts, a hansom, a four-wheeler with a pile of
			boxes, a fishmonger&rsquo;s cart. I turned with spots of colour swimming before
			my eyes to the shadowy fixtures behind me. My excitement was giving place to a
			clear apprehension of my position again. The room was full of a faint scent of
			benzoline, used, I suppose, in cleaning the garments.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I began a systematic search of the place. I should judge the hunchback
			had been alone in the house for some time. He was a curious person. Everything
			that could possibly be of service to me I collected in the clothes storeroom,
			and then I made a deliberate selection. I found a handbag I thought a suitable
			possession, and some powder, rouge, and sticking-plaster.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I had thought of painting and powdering my face and all that there was
			to show of me, in order to render myself visible, but the disadvantage of this
			lay in the fact that I should require turpentine and other appliances and a
			considerable amount of time before I could vanish again. Finally I chose a mask
			of the better type, slightly grotesque but not more so than many human beings,
			dark glasses, greyish whiskers, and a wig. I could find no underclothing, but
			that I could buy subsequently, and for the time I swathed myself in calico
			dominoes and some white cashmere scarfs. I could find no socks, but the
			hunchback&rsquo;s boots were rather a loose fit and sufficed. In a desk in the
			shop were three sovereigns and about thirty shillings&rsquo; worth of silver,
			and in a locked cupboard I burst in the inner room were eight pounds in gold. I
			could go forth into the world again, equipped.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Then came a curious hesitation. Was my appearance really credible? I
			tried myself with a little bedroom looking-glass, inspecting myself from every
			point of view to discover any forgotten chink, but it all seemed sound. I was
			grotesque to the theatrical pitch, a stage miser, but I was certainly not a
			physical impossibility. Gathering confidence, I took my looking-glass down into
			the shop, pulled down the shop blinds, and surveyed myself from every point of
			view with the help of the cheval glass in the corner.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I spent some minutes screwing up my courage and then unlocked the shop
			door and marched out into the street, leaving the little man to get out of his
			sheet again when he liked. In five minutes a dozen turnings intervened between
			me and the costumier&rsquo;s shop. No one appeared to notice me very pointedly.
			My last difficulty seemed overcome.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He stopped again.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;And you troubled no more about the hunchback?&rdquo; said Kemp.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Invisible Man. &ldquo;Nor have I heard what became
			of him. I suppose he untied himself or kicked himself out. The knots were
			pretty tight.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He became silent and went to the window and stared out.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What happened when you went out into the Strand?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;disillusionment again. I thought my troubles were over.
			Practically I thought I had impunity to do whatever I chose,
			everything&mdash;save to give away my secret. So I thought. Whatever I did,
			whatever the consequences might be, was nothing to me. I had merely to fling
			aside my garments and vanish. No person could hold me. I could take my money
			where I found it. I decided to treat myself to a sumptuous feast, and then put
			up at a good hotel, and accumulate a new outfit of property. I felt amazingly
			confident; it&rsquo;s not particularly pleasant recalling that I was an ass. I
			went into a place and was already ordering lunch, when it occurred to me that I
			could not eat unless I exposed my invisible face. I finished ordering the
			lunch, told the man I should be back in ten minutes, and went out exasperated.
			I don&rsquo;t know if you have ever been disappointed in your appetite.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Not quite so badly,&rdquo; said Kemp, &ldquo;but I can imagine
			it.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I could have smashed the silly devils. At last, faint with the desire
			for tasteful food, I went into another place and demanded a private room.
			&lsquo;I am disfigured,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Badly.&rsquo; They looked at me
			curiously, but of course it was not their affair&mdash;and so at last I got my
			lunch. It was not particularly well served, but it sufficed; and when I had had
			it, I sat over a cigar, trying to plan my line of action. And outside a
			snowstorm was beginning.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;The more I thought it over, Kemp, the more I realised what a helpless
			absurdity an Invisible Man was&mdash;in a cold and dirty climate and a crowded
			civilised city. Before I made this mad experiment I had dreamt of a thousand
			advantages. That afternoon it seemed all disappointment. I went over the heads
			of the things a man reckons desirable. No doubt invisibility made it possible
			to get them, but it made it impossible to enjoy them when they are got.
			Ambition&mdash;what is the good of pride of place when you cannot appear there?
			What is the good of the love of woman when her name must needs be Delilah? I
			have no taste for politics, for the blackguardisms of fame, for philanthropy,
			for sport. What was I to do? And for this I had become a wrapped-up mystery, a
			swathed and bandaged caricature of a man!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He paused, and his attitude suggested a roving glance at the window.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But how did you get to Iping?&rdquo; said Kemp, anxious to keep his
			guest busy talking.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I went there to work. I had one hope. It was a half idea! I have it
			still. It is a full blown idea now. A way of getting back! Of restoring what I
			have done. When I choose. When I have done all I mean to do invisibly. And that
			is what I chiefly want to talk to you about now.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You went straight to Iping?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Yes. I had simply to get my three volumes of memoranda and my
			cheque-book, my luggage and underclothing, order a quantity of chemicals to
			work out this idea of mine&mdash;I will show you the calculations as soon as I
			get my books&mdash;and then I started. Jove! I remember the snowstorm now, and
			the accursed bother it was to keep the snow from damping my pasteboard
			nose.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;At the end,&rdquo; said Kemp, &ldquo;the day before yesterday, when they
			found you out, you rather&mdash;to judge by the papers&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I did. Rather. Did I kill that fool of a constable?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Kemp. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s expected to recover.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his luck, then. I clean lost my temper, the fools! Why
			couldn&rsquo;t they leave me alone? And that grocer lout?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;There are no deaths expected,&rdquo; said Kemp.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that tramp of mine,&rdquo; said the Invisible
			Man, with an unpleasant laugh.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;By Heaven, Kemp, you don&rsquo;t know what rage <i>is</i>! ... To have
			worked for years, to have planned and plotted, and then to get some fumbling
			purblind idiot messing across your course! ... Every conceivable sort of silly
			creature that has ever been created has been sent to cross me.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;If I have much more of it, I shall go wild&mdash;I shall start mowing
			&rsquo;em.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;As it is, they&rsquo;ve made things a thousand times more
			difficult.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;No doubt it&rsquo;s exasperating,&rdquo; said Kemp, drily.

			THE PLAN THAT FAILED</h2>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; said Kemp, with a side glance out of the window,
			&ldquo;what are we to do?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He moved nearer his guest as he spoke in such a manner as to prevent the
			possibility of a sudden glimpse of the three men who were advancing up the hill
			road&mdash;with an intolerable slowness, as it seemed to Kemp.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What were you planning to do when you were heading for Port Burdock?
			<i>Had</i> you any plan?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I was going to clear out of the country. But I have altered that plan
			rather since seeing you. I thought it would be wise, now the weather is hot and
			invisibility possible, to make for the South. Especially as my secret was
			known, and everyone would be on the lookout for a masked and muffled man. You
			have a line of steamers from here to France. My idea was to get aboard one and
			run the risks of the passage. Thence I could go by train into Spain, or else
			get to Algiers. It would not be difficult. There a man might always be
			invisible&mdash;and yet live. And do things. I was using that tramp as a money
			box and luggage carrier, until I decided how to get my books and things sent
			over to meet me.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;That&rsquo;s clear.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;And then the filthy brute must needs try and rob me! He <i>has</i>
			hidden my books, Kemp. Hidden my books! If I can lay my hands on him!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Best plan to get the books out of him first.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But where is he? Do you know?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in the town police station, locked up, by his own request, in
			the strongest cell in the place.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Cur!&rdquo; said the Invisible Man.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But that hangs up your plans a little.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;We must get those books; those books are vital.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Kemp, a little nervously, wondering if he heard
			footsteps outside. &ldquo;Certainly we must get those books. But that
			won&rsquo;t be difficult, if he doesn&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re for
			you.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Invisible Man, and thought.
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp tried to think of something to keep the talk going, but the Invisible Man
			resumed of his own accord.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Blundering into your house, Kemp,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;changes all my
			plans. For you are a man that can understand. In spite of all that has
			happened, in spite of this publicity, of the loss of my books, of what I have
			suffered, there still remain great possibilities, huge
			possibilities&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You have told no one I am here?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp hesitated. &ldquo;That was implied,&rdquo; he said.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;No one?&rdquo; insisted Griffin.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Not a soul.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Ah! Now&mdash;&rdquo; The Invisible Man stood up, and sticking his arms
			akimbo began to pace the study.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I made a mistake, Kemp, a huge mistake, in carrying this thing through
			alone. I have wasted strength, time, opportunities. Alone&mdash;it is wonderful
			how little a man can do alone! To rob a little, to hurt a little, and there is
			the end.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What I want, Kemp, is a goal-keeper, a helper, and a hiding-place, an
			arrangement whereby I can sleep and eat and rest in peace, and unsuspected. I
			must have a confederate. With a confederate, with food and rest&mdash;a
			thousand things are possible.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Hitherto I have gone on vague lines. We have to consider all that
			invisibility means, all that it does not mean. It means little advantage for
			eavesdropping and so forth&mdash;one makes sounds. It&rsquo;s of little
			help&mdash;a little help perhaps&mdash;in housebreaking and so forth. Once
			you&rsquo;ve caught me you could easily imprison me. But on the other hand I am
			hard to catch. This invisibility, in fact, is only good in two cases:
			It&rsquo;s useful in getting away, it&rsquo;s useful in approaching. It&rsquo;s
			particularly useful, therefore, in killing. I can walk round a man, whatever
			weapon he has, choose my point, strike as I like. Dodge as I like. Escape as I
			like.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp&rsquo;s hand went to his moustache. Was that a movement downstairs?
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;And it is killing we must do, Kemp.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It is killing we must do,&rdquo; repeated Kemp. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
			listening to your plan, Griffin, but I&rsquo;m not agreeing, mind. <i>Why</i>
			killing?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Not wanton killing, but a judicious slaying. The point is, they know
			there is an Invisible Man&mdash;as well as we know there is an Invisible Man.
			And that Invisible Man, Kemp, must now establish a Reign of Terror. Yes; no
			doubt it&rsquo;s startling. But I mean it. A Reign of Terror. He must take some
			town like your Burdock and terrify and dominate it. He must issue his orders.
			He can do that in a thousand ways&mdash;scraps of paper thrust under doors
			would suffice. And all who disobey his orders he must kill, and kill all who
			would defend them.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Kemp, no longer listening to Griffin but to the sound
			of his front door opening and closing.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It seems to me, Griffin,&rdquo; he said, to cover his wandering
			attention, &ldquo;that your confederate would be in a difficult
			position.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;No one would know he was a confederate,&rdquo; said the Invisible Man,
			eagerly. And then suddenly, &ldquo;Hush! What&rsquo;s that downstairs?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Kemp, and suddenly began to speak loud and fast.
			&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree to this, Griffin,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Understand
			me, I don&rsquo;t agree to this. Why dream of playing a game against the race?
			How can you hope to gain happiness? Don&rsquo;t be a lone wolf. Publish your
			results; take the world&mdash;take the nation at least&mdash;into your
			confidence. Think what you might do with a million helpers&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			The Invisible Man interrupted&mdash;arm extended. &ldquo;There are footsteps
			coming upstairs,&rdquo; he said in a low voice.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Kemp.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said the Invisible Man, and advanced, arm extended,
			to the door.
		</p>

		<p>
			And then things happened very swiftly. Kemp hesitated for a second and then
			moved to intercept him. The Invisible Man started and stood still.
			&ldquo;Traitor!&rdquo; cried the Voice, and suddenly the dressing-gown opened,
			and sitting down the Unseen began to disrobe. Kemp made three swift steps to
			the door, and forthwith the Invisible Man&mdash;his legs had
			vanished&mdash;sprang to his feet with a shout. Kemp flung the door open.
		</p>

		<p>
			As it opened, there came a sound of hurrying feet downstairs and voices.
		</p>

		<p>
			With a quick movement Kemp thrust the Invisible Man back, sprang aside, and
			slammed the door. The key was outside and ready. In another moment Griffin
			would have been alone in the belvedere study, a prisoner. Save for one little
			thing. The key had been slipped in hastily that morning. As Kemp slammed the
			door it fell noisily upon the carpet.
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp&rsquo;s face became white. He tried to grip the door handle with both
			hands. For a moment he stood lugging. Then the door gave six inches. But he got
			it closed again. The second time it was jerked a foot wide, and the
			dressing-gown came wedging itself into the opening. His throat was gripped by
			invisible fingers, and he left his hold on the handle to defend himself. He was
			forced back, tripped and pitched heavily into the corner of the landing. The
			empty dressing-gown was flung on the top of him.
		</p>

		<p>
			Halfway up the staircase was Colonel Adye, the recipient of Kemp&rsquo;s
			letter, the chief of the Burdock police. He was staring aghast at the sudden
			appearance of Kemp, followed by the extraordinary sight of clothing tossing
			empty in the air. He saw Kemp felled, and struggling to his feet. He saw him
			rush forward, and go down again, felled like an ox.
		</p>

		<p>
			Then suddenly he was struck violently. By nothing! A vast weight, it seemed,
			leapt upon him, and he was hurled headlong down the staircase, with a grip on
			his throat and a knee in his groin. An invisible foot trod on his back, a
			ghostly patter passed downstairs, he heard the two police officers in the hall
			shout and run, and the front door of the house slammed violently.
		</p>

		<p>
			He rolled over and sat up staring. He saw, staggering down the staircase, Kemp,
			dusty and disheveled, one side of his face white from a blow, his lip bleeding,
			and a pink dressing-gown and some underclothing held in his arms.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; cried Kemp, &ldquo;the game&rsquo;s up! He&rsquo;s
			gone!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<h2><a name="chap25"></a>CHAPTER XXV.<br />
			THE HUNTING OF THE INVISIBLE MAN</h2>

		<p>
			For a space Kemp was too inarticulate to make Adye understand the swift things
			that had just happened. They stood on the landing, Kemp speaking swiftly, the
			grotesque swathings of Griffin still on his arm. But presently Adye began to
			grasp something of the situation.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;He is mad,&rdquo; said Kemp; &ldquo;inhuman. He is pure selfishness. He
			thinks of nothing but his own advantage, his own safety. I have listened to
			such a story this morning of brutal self-seeking.... He has wounded men. He
			will kill them unless we can prevent him. He will create a panic. Nothing can
			stop him. He is going out now&mdash;furious!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;He must be caught,&rdquo; said Adye. &ldquo;That is certain.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; cried Kemp, and suddenly became full of ideas.
			&ldquo;You must begin at once. You must set every available man to work; you
			must prevent his leaving this district. Once he gets away, he may go through
			the countryside as he wills, killing and maiming. He dreams of a reign of
			terror! A reign of terror, I tell you. You must set a watch on trains and roads
			and shipping. The garrison must help. You must wire for help. The only thing
			that may keep him here is the thought of recovering some books of notes he
			counts of value. I will tell you of that! There is a man in your police
			station&mdash;Marvel.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Adye, &ldquo;I know. Those books&mdash;yes. But the
			tramp....&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Says he hasn&rsquo;t them. But he thinks the tramp has. And you must
			prevent him from eating or sleeping; day and night the country must be astir
			for him. Food must be locked up and secured, all food, so that he will have to
			break his way to it. The houses everywhere must be barred against him. Heaven
			send us cold nights and rain! The whole country-side must begin hunting and
			keep hunting. I tell you, Adye, he is a danger, a disaster; unless he is pinned
			and secured, it is frightful to think of the things that may happen.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What else can we do?&rdquo; said Adye. &ldquo;I must go down at once and
			begin organising. But why not come? Yes&mdash;you come too! Come, and we must
			hold a sort of council of war&mdash;get Hopps to help&mdash;and the railway
			managers. By Jove! it&rsquo;s urgent. Come along&mdash;tell me as we go. What
			else is there we can do? Put that stuff down.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			In another moment Adye was leading the way downstairs. They found the front
			door open and the policemen standing outside staring at empty air.
			&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got away, sir,&rdquo; said one.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;We must go to the central station at once,&rdquo; said Adye. &ldquo;One
			of you go on down and get a cab to come up and meet us&mdash;quickly. And now,
			Kemp, what else?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Dogs,&rdquo; said Kemp. &ldquo;Get dogs. They don&rsquo;t see him, but
			they wind him. Get dogs.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Adye. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not generally known, but the
			prison officials over at Halstead know a man with bloodhounds. Dogs. What
			else?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Bear in mind,&rdquo; said Kemp, &ldquo;his food shows. After eating, his
			food shows until it is assimilated. So that he has to hide after eating. You
			must keep on beating. Every thicket, every quiet corner. And put all
			weapons&mdash;all implements that might be weapons, away. He can&rsquo;t carry
			such things for long. And what he can snatch up and strike men with must be
			hidden away.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Good again,&rdquo; said Adye. &ldquo;We shall have him yet!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;And on the roads,&rdquo; said Kemp, and hesitated.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Adye.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Powdered glass,&rdquo; said Kemp. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cruel, I know. But
			think of what he may do!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Adye drew the air in sharply between his teeth. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
			unsportsmanlike. I don&rsquo;t know. But I&rsquo;ll have powdered glass got
			ready. If he goes too far....&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;The man&rsquo;s become inhuman, I tell you,&rdquo; said Kemp. &ldquo;I
			am as sure he will establish a reign of terror&mdash;so soon as he has got over
			the emotions of this escape&mdash;as I am sure I am talking to you. Our only
			chance is to be ahead. He has cut himself off from his kind. His blood be upon
			his own head.&rdquo;

		<h2><a name="chap26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
			THE WICKSTEED MURDER</h2>

		<p>
			The Invisible Man seems to have rushed out of Kemp&rsquo;s house in a state of
			blind fury. A little child playing near Kemp&rsquo;s gateway was violently
			caught up and thrown aside, so that its ankle was broken, and thereafter for
			some hours the Invisible Man passed out of human perceptions. No one knows
			where he went nor what he did. But one can imagine him hurrying through the hot
			June forenoon, up the hill and on to the open downland behind Port Burdock,
			raging and despairing at his intolerable fate, and sheltering at last, heated
			and weary, amid the thickets of Hintondean, to piece together again his
			shattered schemes against his species. That seems the most probable refuge for
			him, for there it was he re-asserted himself in a grimly tragical manner about
			two in the afternoon.
		</p>

		<p>
			One wonders what his state of mind may have been during that time, and what
			plans he devised. No doubt he was almost ecstatically exasperated by
			Kemp&rsquo;s treachery, and though we may be able to understand the motives
			that led to that deceit, we may still imagine and even sympathise a little with
			the fury the attempted surprise must have occasioned. Perhaps something of the
			stunned astonishment of his Oxford Street experiences may have returned to him,
			for he had evidently counted on Kemp&rsquo;s co-operation in his brutal dream
			of a terrorised world. At any rate he vanished from human ken about midday, and
			no living witness can tell what he did until about half-past two. It was a
			fortunate thing, perhaps, for humanity, but for him it was a fatal inaction.
		</p>

		<p>
			During that time a growing multitude of men scattered over the countryside were
			busy. In the morning he had still been simply a legend, a terror; in the
			afternoon, by virtue chiefly of Kemp&rsquo;s drily worded proclamation, he was
			presented as a tangible antagonist, to be wounded, captured, or overcome, and
			the countryside began organising itself with inconceivable rapidity. By two
			o&rsquo;clock even he might still have removed himself out of the district by
			getting aboard a train, but after two that became impossible. Every passenger
			train along the lines on a great parallelogram between Southampton, Manchester,
			Brighton and Horsham, travelled with locked doors, and the goods traffic was
			almost entirely suspended. And in a great circle of twenty miles round Port
			Burdock, men armed with guns and bludgeons were presently setting out in groups
			of three and four, with dogs, to beat the roads and fields.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mounted policemen rode along the country lanes, stopping at every cottage and
			warning the people to lock up their houses, and keep indoors unless they were
			armed, and all the elementary schools had broken up by three o&rsquo;clock, and
			the children, scared and keeping together in groups, were hurrying home.
			Kemp&rsquo;s proclamation&mdash;signed indeed by Adye&mdash;was posted over
			almost the whole district by four or five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. It
			gave briefly but clearly all the conditions of the struggle, the necessity of
			keeping the Invisible Man from food and sleep, the necessity for incessant
			watchfulness and for a prompt attention to any evidence of his movements. And
			so swift and decided was the action of the authorities, so prompt and universal
			was the belief in this strange being, that before nightfall an area of several
			hundred square miles was in a stringent state of siege. And before nightfall,
			too, a thrill of horror went through the whole watching nervous countryside.
			Going from whispering mouth to mouth, swift and certain over the length and
			breadth of the country, passed the story of the murder of Mr. Wicksteed.
		</p>

		<p>
			If our supposition that the Invisible Man&rsquo;s refuge was the Hintondean
			thickets, then we must suppose that in the early afternoon he sallied out again
			bent upon some project that involved the use of a weapon. We cannot know what
			the project was, but the evidence that he had the iron rod in hand before he
			met Wicksteed is to me at least overwhelming.
		</p>

		<p>
			Of course we can know nothing of the details of that encounter. It occurred on
			the edge of a gravel pit, not two hundred yards from Lord Burdock&rsquo;s lodge
			gate. Everything points to a desperate struggle&mdash;the trampled ground, the
			numerous wounds Mr. Wicksteed received, his splintered walking-stick; but why
			the attack was made, save in a murderous frenzy, it is impossible to imagine.
			Indeed the theory of madness is almost unavoidable. Mr. Wicksteed was a man of
			forty-five or forty-six, steward to Lord Burdock, of inoffensive habits and
			appearance, the very last person in the world to provoke such a terrible
			antagonist. Against him it would seem the Invisible Man used an iron rod
			dragged from a broken piece of fence. He stopped this quiet man, going quietly
			home to his midday meal, attacked him, beat down his feeble defences, broke his
			arm, felled him, and smashed his head to a jelly.
		</p>

		<p>
			Of course, he must have dragged this rod out of the fencing before he met his
			victim&mdash;he must have been carrying it ready in his hand. Only two details
			beyond what has already been stated seem to bear on the matter. One is the
			circumstance that the gravel pit was not in Mr. Wicksteed&rsquo;s direct path
			home, but nearly a couple of hundred yards out of his way. The other is the
			assertion of a little girl to the effect that, going to her afternoon school,
			she saw the murdered man &ldquo;trotting&rdquo; in a peculiar manner across a
			field towards the gravel pit. Her pantomime of his action suggests a man
			pursuing something on the ground before him and striking at it ever and again
			with his walking-stick. She was the last person to see him alive. He passed out
			of her sight to his death, the struggle being hidden from her only by a clump
			of beech trees and a slight depression in the ground.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now this, to the present writer&rsquo;s mind at least, lifts the murder out of
			the realm of the absolutely wanton. We may imagine that Griffin had taken the
			rod as a weapon indeed, but without any deliberate intention of using it in
			murder. Wicksteed may then have come by and noticed this rod inexplicably
			moving through the air. Without any thought of the Invisible Man&mdash;for Port
			Burdock is ten miles away&mdash;he may have pursued it. It is quite conceivable
			that he may not even have heard of the Invisible Man. One can then imagine the
			Invisible Man making off&mdash;quietly in order to avoid discovering his
			presence in the neighbourhood, and Wicksteed, excited and curious, pursuing
			this unaccountably locomotive object&mdash;finally striking at it.
		</p>

		<p>
			No doubt the Invisible Man could easily have distanced his middle-aged pursuer
			under ordinary circumstances, but the position in which Wicksteed&rsquo;s body
			was found suggests that he had the ill luck to drive his quarry into a corner
			between a drift of stinging nettles and the gravel pit. To those who appreciate
			the extraordinary irascibility of the Invisible Man, the rest of the encounter
			will be easy to imagine.
		</p>

		<p>
			But this is pure hypothesis. The only undeniable facts&mdash;for stories of
			children are often unreliable&mdash;are the discovery of Wicksteed&rsquo;s
			body, done to death, and of the blood-stained iron rod flung among the nettles.
			The abandonment of the rod by Griffin, suggests that in the emotional
			excitement of the affair, the purpose for which he took it&mdash;if he had a
			purpose&mdash;was abandoned. He was certainly an intensely egotistical and
			unfeeling man, but the sight of his victim, his first victim, bloody and
			pitiful at his feet, may have released some long pent fountain of remorse which
			for a time may have flooded whatever scheme of action he had contrived.
		</p>

		<p>
			After the murder of Mr. Wicksteed, he would seem to have struck across the
			country towards the downland. There is a story of a voice heard about sunset by
			a couple of men in a field near Fern Bottom. It was wailing and laughing,
			sobbing and groaning, and ever and again it shouted. It must have been queer
			hearing. It drove up across the middle of a clover field and died away towards
			the hills.
		</p>

		<p>
			That afternoon the Invisible Man must have learnt something of the rapid use
			Kemp had made of his confidences. He must have found houses locked and secured;
			he may have loitered about railway stations and prowled about inns, and no
			doubt he read the proclamations and realised something of the nature of the
			campaign against him. And as the evening advanced, the fields became dotted
			here and there with groups of three or four men, and noisy with the yelping of
			dogs. These men-hunters had particular instructions in the case of an encounter
			as to the way they should support one another. But he avoided them all. We may
			understand something of his exasperation, and it could have been none the less
			because he himself had supplied the information that was being used so
			remorselessly against him. For that day at least he lost heart; for nearly
			twenty-four hours, save when he turned on Wicksteed, he was a hunted man. In
			the night, he must have eaten and slept; for in the morning he was himself
			again, active, powerful, angry, and malignant, prepared for his last great
			struggle against the world.

		<h2><a name="chap27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
			THE SIEGE OF KEMP&rsquo;S HOUSE</h2>

		<p>
			Kemp read a strange missive, written in pencil on a greasy sheet of paper.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You have been amazingly energetic and clever,&rdquo; this letter ran,
			&ldquo;though what you stand to gain by it I cannot imagine. You are against
			me. For a whole day you have chased me; you have tried to rob me of a
			night&rsquo;s rest. But I have had food in spite of you, I have slept in spite
			of you, and the game is only beginning. The game is only beginning. There is
			nothing for it, but to start the Terror. This announces the first day of the
			Terror. Port Burdock is no longer under the Queen, tell your Colonel of Police,
			and the rest of them; it is under me&mdash;the Terror! This is day one of year
			one of the new epoch&mdash;the Epoch of the Invisible Man. I am Invisible Man
			the First. To begin with the rule will be easy. The first day there will be one
			execution for the sake of example&mdash;a man named Kemp. Death starts for him
			to-day. He may lock himself away, hide himself away, get guards about him, put
			on armour if he likes&mdash;Death, the unseen Death, is coming. Let him take
			precautions; it will impress my people. Death starts from the pillar box by
			midday. The letter will fall in as the postman comes along, then off! The game
			begins. Death starts. Help him not, my people, lest Death fall upon you also.
			To-day Kemp is to die.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp read this letter twice, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no hoax,&rdquo; he said.
			&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his voice! And he means it.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He turned the folded sheet over and saw on the addressed side of it the
			postmark Hintondean, and the prosaic detail &ldquo;2d. to pay.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He got up slowly, leaving his lunch unfinished&mdash;the letter had come by the
			one o&rsquo;clock post&mdash;and went into his study. He rang for his
			housekeeper, and told her to go round the house at once, examine all the
			fastenings of the windows, and close all the shutters. He closed the shutters
			of his study himself. From a locked drawer in his bedroom he took a little
			revolver, examined it carefully, and put it into the pocket of his lounge
			jacket. He wrote a number of brief notes, one to Colonel Adye, gave them to his
			servant to take, with explicit instructions as to her way of leaving the house.
			&ldquo;There is no danger,&rdquo; he said, and added a mental reservation,
			&ldquo;to you.&rdquo; He remained meditative for a space after doing this, and
			then returned to his cooling lunch.
		</p>

		<p>
			He ate with gaps of thought. Finally he struck the table sharply. &ldquo;We
			will have him!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and I am the bait. He will come too
			far.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He went up to the belvedere, carefully shutting every door after him.
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a game,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an odd game&mdash;but the
			chances are all for me, Mr. Griffin, in spite of your invisibility. Griffin
			<i>contra mundum</i> ... with a vengeance.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He stood at the window staring at the hot hillside. &ldquo;He must get food
			every day&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t envy him. Did he really sleep last night? Out
			in the open somewhere&mdash;secure from collisions. I wish we could get some
			good cold wet weather instead of the heat.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;He may be watching me now.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He went close to the window. Something rapped smartly against the brickwork
			over the frame, and made him start violently back.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting nervous,&rdquo; said Kemp. But it was five minutes
			before he went to the window again. &ldquo;It must have been a sparrow,&rdquo;
			he said.
		</p>

		<p>
			Presently he heard the front-door bell ringing, and hurried downstairs. He
			unbolted and unlocked the door, examined the chain, put it up, and opened
			cautiously without showing himself. A familiar voice hailed him. It was Adye.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Your servant&rsquo;s been assaulted, Kemp,&rdquo; he said round the
			door.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Kemp.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Had that note of yours taken away from her. He&rsquo;s close about here.
			Let me in.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp released the chain, and Adye entered through as narrow an opening as
			possible. He stood in the hall, looking with infinite relief at Kemp
			refastening the door. &ldquo;Note was snatched out of her hand. Scared her
			horribly. She&rsquo;s down at the station. Hysterics. He&rsquo;s close here.
			What was it about?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp swore.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What a fool I was,&rdquo; said Kemp. &ldquo;I might have known.
			It&rsquo;s not an hour&rsquo;s walk from Hintondean. Already?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; said Adye.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; said Kemp, and led the way into his study. He handed
			Adye the Invisible Man&rsquo;s letter. Adye read it and whistled softly.
			&ldquo;And you&mdash;?&rdquo; said Adye.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Proposed a trap&mdash;like a fool,&rdquo; said Kemp, &ldquo;and sent my
			proposal out by a maid servant. To him.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Adye followed Kemp&rsquo;s profanity.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll clear out,&rdquo; said Adye.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Not he,&rdquo; said Kemp.
		</p>

		<p>
			A resounding smash of glass came from upstairs. Adye had a silvery glimpse of a
			little revolver half out of Kemp&rsquo;s pocket. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a window,
			upstairs!&rdquo; said Kemp, and led the way up. There came a second smash while
			they were still on the staircase. When they reached the study they found two of
			the three windows smashed, half the room littered with splintered glass, and
			one big flint lying on the writing table. The two men stopped in the doorway,
			contemplating the wreckage. Kemp swore again, and as he did so the third window
			went with a snap like a pistol, hung starred for a moment, and collapsed in
			jagged, shivering triangles into the room.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this for?&rdquo; said Adye.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beginning,&rdquo; said Kemp.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way of climbing up here?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Not for a cat,&rdquo; said Kemp.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;No shutters?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Not here. All the downstairs rooms&mdash;Hullo!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Smash, and then whack of boards hit hard came from downstairs. &ldquo;Confound
			him!&rdquo; said Kemp. &ldquo;That must be&mdash;yes&mdash;it&rsquo;s one of
			the bedrooms. He&rsquo;s going to do all the house. But he&rsquo;s a fool. The
			shutters are up, and the glass will fall outside. He&rsquo;ll cut his
			feet.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Another window proclaimed its destruction. The two men stood on the landing
			perplexed. &ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; said Adye. &ldquo;Let me have a stick or
			something, and I&rsquo;ll go down to the station and get the bloodhounds put
			on. That ought to settle him! They&rsquo;re hard by&mdash;not ten
			minutes&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Another window went the way of its fellows.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t a revolver?&rdquo; asked Adye.
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp&rsquo;s hand went to his pocket. Then he hesitated. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
			one&mdash;at least to spare.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring it back,&rdquo; said Adye, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be safe
			here.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp, ashamed of his momentary lapse from truthfulness, handed him the weapon.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Now for the door,&rdquo; said Adye.
		</p>

		<p>
			As they stood hesitating in the hall, they heard one of the first-floor bedroom
			windows crack and clash. Kemp went to the door and began to slip the bolts as
			silently as possible. His face was a little paler than usual. &ldquo;You must
			step straight out,&rdquo; said Kemp. In another moment Adye was on the doorstep
			and the bolts were dropping back into the staples. He hesitated for a moment,
			feeling more comfortable with his back against the door. Then he marched,
			upright and square, down the steps. He crossed the lawn and approached the
			gate. A little breeze seemed to ripple over the grass. Something moved near
			him. &ldquo;Stop a bit,&rdquo; said a Voice, and Adye stopped dead and his hand
			tightened on the revolver.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Adye, white and grim, and every nerve tense.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Oblige me by going back to the house,&rdquo; said the Voice, as tense
			and grim as Adye&rsquo;s.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; said Adye a little hoarsely, and moistened his lips with
			his tongue. The Voice was on his left front, he thought. Suppose he were to
			take his luck with a shot?
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What are you going for?&rdquo; said the Voice, and there was a quick
			movement of the two, and a flash of sunlight from the open lip of Adye&rsquo;s
			pocket.
		</p>

		<p>
			Adye desisted and thought. &ldquo;Where I go,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;is
			my own business.&rdquo; The words were still on his lips, when an arm came
			round his neck, his back felt a knee, and he was sprawling backward. He drew
			clumsily and fired absurdly, and in another moment he was struck in the mouth
			and the revolver wrested from his grip. He made a vain clutch at a slippery
			limb, tried to struggle up and fell back. &ldquo;Damn!&rdquo; said Adye. The
			Voice laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d kill you now if it wasn&rsquo;t the waste of a
			bullet,&rdquo; it said. He saw the revolver in mid-air, six feet off, covering
			him.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Adye, sitting up.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; said the Voice.
		</p>

		<p>
			Adye stood up.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Attention,&rdquo; said the Voice, and then fiercely, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
			try any games. Remember I can see your face if you can&rsquo;t see mine.
			You&rsquo;ve got to go back to the house.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t let me in,&rdquo; said Adye.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pity,&rdquo; said the Invisible Man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
			got no quarrel with you.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Adye moistened his lips again. He glanced away from the barrel of the revolver
			and saw the sea far off very blue and dark under the midday sun, the smooth
			green down, the white cliff of the Head, and the multitudinous town, and
			suddenly he knew that life was very sweet. His eyes came back to this little
			metal thing hanging between heaven and earth, six yards away. &ldquo;What am I
			to do?&rdquo; he said sullenly.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What am <i>I</i> to do?&rdquo; asked the Invisible Man. &ldquo;You will
			get help. The only thing is for you to go back.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I will try. If he lets me in will you promise not to rush the
			door?&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got no quarrel with you,&rdquo; said the Voice.
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp had hurried upstairs after letting Adye out, and now crouching among the
			broken glass and peering cautiously over the edge of the study window sill, he
			saw Adye stand parleying with the Unseen. &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t he
			fire?&rdquo; whispered Kemp to himself. Then the revolver moved a little and
			the glint of the sunlight flashed in Kemp&rsquo;s eyes. He shaded his eyes and
			tried to see the source of the blinding beam.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Surely!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Adye has given up the revolver.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Promise not to rush the door,&rdquo; Adye was saying. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
			push a winning game too far. Give a man a chance.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You go back to the house. I tell you flatly I will not promise
			anything.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Adye&rsquo;s decision seemed suddenly made. He turned towards the house,
			walking slowly with his hands behind him. Kemp watched him&mdash;puzzled. The
			revolver vanished, flashed again into sight, vanished again, and became evident
			on a closer scrutiny as a little dark object following Adye. Then things
			happened very quickly. Adye leapt backwards, swung around, clutched at this
			little object, missed it, threw up his hands and fell forward on his face,
			leaving a little puff of blue in the air. Kemp did not hear the sound of the
			shot. Adye writhed, raised himself on one arm, fell forward, and lay still.
		</p>

		<p>
			For a space Kemp remained staring at the quiet carelessness of Adye&rsquo;s
			attitude. The afternoon was very hot and still, nothing seemed stirring in all
			the world save a couple of yellow butterflies chasing each other through the
			shrubbery between the house and the road gate. Adye lay on the lawn near the
			gate. The blinds of all the villas down the hill-road were drawn, but in one
			little green summer-house was a white figure, apparently an old man asleep.
			Kemp scrutinised the surroundings of the house for a glimpse of the revolver,
			but it had vanished. His eyes came back to Adye. The game was opening well.
		</p>

		<p>
			Then came a ringing and knocking at the front door, that grew at last
			tumultuous, but pursuant to Kemp&rsquo;s instructions the servants had locked
			themselves into their rooms. This was followed by a silence. Kemp sat listening
			and then began peering cautiously out of the three windows, one after another.
			He went to the staircase head and stood listening uneasily. He armed himself
			with his bedroom poker, and went to examine the interior fastenings of the
			ground-floor windows again. Everything was safe and quiet. He returned to the
			belvedere. Adye lay motionless over the edge of the gravel just as he had
			fallen. Coming along the road by the villas were the housemaid and two
			policemen.
		</p>

		<p>
			Everything was deadly still. The three people seemed very slow in approaching.
			He wondered what his antagonist was doing.
		</p>

		<p>
			He started. There was a smash from below. He hesitated and went downstairs
			again. Suddenly the house resounded with heavy blows and the splintering of
			wood. He heard a smash and the destructive clang of the iron fastenings of the
			shutters. He turned the key and opened the kitchen door. As he did so, the
			shutters, split and splintering, came flying inward. He stood aghast. The
			window frame, save for one crossbar, was still intact, but only little teeth of
			glass remained in the frame. The shutters had been driven in with an axe, and
			now the axe was descending in sweeping blows upon the window frame and the iron
			bars defending it. Then suddenly it leapt aside and vanished. He saw the
			revolver lying on the path outside, and then the little weapon sprang into the
			air. He dodged back. The revolver cracked just too late, and a splinter from
			the edge of the closing door flashed over his head. He slammed and locked the
			door, and as he stood outside he heard Griffin shouting and laughing. Then the
			blows of the axe with its splitting and smashing consequences, were resumed.
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp stood in the passage trying to think. In a moment the Invisible Man would
			be in the kitchen. This door would not keep him a moment, and then&mdash;
		</p>

		<p>
			A ringing came at the front door again. It would be the policemen. He ran into
			the hall, put up the chain, and drew the bolts. He made the girl speak before
			he dropped the chain, and the three people blundered into the house in a heap,
			and Kemp slammed the door again.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;The Invisible Man!&rdquo; said Kemp. &ldquo;He has a revolver, with two
			shots&mdash;left. He&rsquo;s killed Adye. Shot him anyhow. Didn&rsquo;t you see
			him on the lawn? He&rsquo;s lying there.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; said one of the policemen.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Adye,&rdquo; said Kemp.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;We came in the back way,&rdquo; said the girl.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that smashing?&rdquo; asked one of the policemen.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in the kitchen&mdash;or will be. He has found an
			axe&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Suddenly the house was full of the Invisible Man&rsquo;s resounding blows on
			the kitchen door. The girl stared towards the kitchen, shuddered, and retreated
			into the dining-room. Kemp tried to explain in broken sentences. They heard the
			kitchen door give.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;This way,&rdquo; said Kemp, starting into activity, and bundled the
			policemen into the dining-room doorway.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Poker,&rdquo; said Kemp, and rushed to the fender. He handed the poker
			he had carried to the policeman and the dining-room one to the other. He
			suddenly flung himself backward.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Whup!&rdquo; said one policeman, ducked, and caught the axe on his
			poker. The pistol snapped its penultimate shot and ripped a valuable Sidney
			Cooper. The second policeman brought his poker down on the little weapon, as
			one might knock down a wasp, and sent it rattling to the floor.
		</p>

		<p>
			At the first clash the girl screamed, stood screaming for a moment by the
			fireplace, and then ran to open the shutters&mdash;possibly with an idea of
			escaping by the shattered window.
		</p>

		<p>
			The axe receded into the passage, and fell to a position about two feet from
			the ground. They could hear the Invisible Man breathing. &ldquo;Stand away, you
			two,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want that man Kemp.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;We want you,&rdquo; said the first policeman, making a quick step
			forward and wiping with his poker at the Voice. The Invisible Man must have
			started back, and he blundered into the umbrella stand.
		</p>

		<p>
			Then, as the policeman staggered with the swing of the blow he had aimed, the
			Invisible Man countered with the axe, the helmet crumpled like paper, and the
			blow sent the man spinning to the floor at the head of the kitchen stairs. But
			the second policeman, aiming behind the axe with his poker, hit something soft
			that snapped. There was a sharp exclamation of pain and then the axe fell to
			the ground. The policeman wiped again at vacancy and hit nothing; he put his
			foot on the axe, and struck again. Then he stood, poker clubbed, listening
			intent for the slightest movement.
		</p>

		<p>
			He heard the dining-room window open, and a quick rush of feet within. His
			companion rolled over and sat up, with the blood running down between his eye
			and ear. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; asked the man on the floor.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve hit him. He&rsquo;s standing somewhere in
			the hall. Unless he&rsquo;s slipped past you. Doctor Kemp&mdash;sir.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Pause.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Doctor Kemp,&rdquo; cried the policeman again.
		</p>

		<p>
			The second policeman began struggling to his feet. He stood up. Suddenly the
			faint pad of bare feet on the kitchen stairs could be heard. &ldquo;Yap!&rdquo;
			cried the first policeman, and incontinently flung his poker. It smashed a
			little gas bracket.
		</p>

		<p>
			He made as if he would pursue the Invisible Man downstairs. Then he thought
			better of it and stepped into the dining-room.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Doctor Kemp&mdash;&rdquo; he began, and stopped short.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Doctor Kemp&rsquo;s a hero,&rdquo; he said, as his companion looked over
			his shoulder.
		</p>

		<p>
			The dining-room window was wide open, and neither housemaid nor Kemp was to be
			seen.
		</p>

		<p>
			The second policeman&rsquo;s opinion of Kemp was terse and vivid.
		</p>

		<h2><a name="chap28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
			THE HUNTER HUNTED</h2>

		<p>
			Mr. Heelas, Mr. Kemp&rsquo;s nearest neighbour among the villa holders, was
			asleep in his summer house when the siege of Kemp&rsquo;s house began. Mr.
			Heelas was one of the sturdy minority who refused to believe &ldquo;in all this
			nonsense&rdquo; about an Invisible Man. His wife, however, as he was
			subsequently to be reminded, did. He insisted upon walking about his garden
			just as if nothing was the matter, and he went to sleep in the afternoon in
			accordance with the custom of years. He slept through the smashing of the
			windows, and then woke up suddenly with a curious persuasion of something
			wrong. He looked across at Kemp&rsquo;s house, rubbed his eyes and looked
			again. Then he put his feet to the ground, and sat listening. He said he was
			damned, but still the strange thing was visible. The house looked as though it
			had been deserted for weeks&mdash;after a violent riot. Every window was
			broken, and every window, save those of the belvedere study, was blinded by the
			internal shutters.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I could have sworn it was all right&rdquo;&mdash;he looked at his
			watch&mdash;&ldquo;twenty minutes ago.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He became aware of a measured concussion and the clash of glass, far away in
			the distance. And then, as he sat open-mouthed, came a still more wonderful
			thing. The shutters of the drawing-room window were flung open violently, and
			the housemaid in her outdoor hat and garments, appeared struggling in a frantic
			manner to throw up the sash. Suddenly a man appeared beside her, helping
			her&mdash;Dr. Kemp! In another moment the window was open, and the housemaid
			was struggling out; she pitched forward and vanished among the shrubs. Mr.
			Heelas stood up, exclaiming vaguely and vehemently at all these wonderful
			things. He saw Kemp stand on the sill, spring from the window, and reappear
			almost instantaneously running along a path in the shrubbery and stooping as he
			ran, like a man who evades observation. He vanished behind a laburnum, and
			appeared again clambering over a fence that abutted on the open down. In a
			second he had tumbled over and was running at a tremendous pace down the slope
			towards Mr. Heelas.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; cried Mr. Heelas, struck with an idea; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
			that Invisible Man brute! It&rsquo;s right, after all!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			With Mr. Heelas to think things like that was to act, and his cook watching him
			from the top window was amazed to see him come pelting towards the house at a
			good nine miles an hour. There was a slamming of doors, a ringing of bells, and
			the voice of Mr. Heelas bellowing like a bull. &ldquo;Shut the doors, shut the
			windows, shut everything!&mdash;the Invisible Man is coming!&rdquo; Instantly
			the house was full of screams and directions, and scurrying feet. He ran
			himself to shut the French windows that opened on the veranda; as he did so
			Kemp&rsquo;s head and shoulders and knee appeared over the edge of the garden
			fence. In another moment Kemp had ploughed through the asparagus, and was
			running across the tennis lawn to the house.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t come in,&rdquo; said Mr. Heelas, shutting the bolts.
			&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry if he&rsquo;s after you, but you can&rsquo;t come
			in!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp appeared with a face of terror close to the glass, rapping and then
			shaking frantically at the French window. Then, seeing his efforts were
			useless, he ran along the veranda, vaulted the end, and went to hammer at the
			side door. Then he ran round by the side gate to the front of the house, and so
			into the hill-road. And Mr. Heelas staring from his window&mdash;a face of
			horror&mdash;had scarcely witnessed Kemp vanish, ere the asparagus was being
			trampled this way and that by feet unseen. At that Mr. Heelas fled
			precipitately upstairs, and the rest of the chase is beyond his purview. But as
			he passed the staircase window, he heard the side gate slam.
		</p>

		<p>
			Emerging into the hill-road, Kemp naturally took the downward direction, and so
			it was he came to run in his own person the very race he had watched with such
			a critical eye from the belvedere study only four days ago. He ran it well, for
			a man out of training, and though his face was white and wet, his wits were
			cool to the last. He ran with wide strides, and wherever a patch of rough
			ground intervened, wherever there came a patch of raw flints, or a bit of
			broken glass shone dazzling, he crossed it and left the bare invisible feet
			that followed to take what line they would.
		</p>

		<p>
			For the first time in his life Kemp discovered that the hill-road was
			indescribably vast and desolate, and that the beginnings of the town far below
			at the hill foot were strangely remote. Never had there been a slower or more
			painful method of progression than running. All the gaunt villas, sleeping in
			the afternoon sun, looked locked and barred; no doubt they were locked and
			barred&mdash;by his own orders. But at any rate they might have kept a lookout
			for an eventuality like this! The town was rising up now, the sea had dropped
			out of sight behind it, and people down below were stirring. A tram was just
			arriving at the hill foot. Beyond that was the police station. Was that
			footsteps he heard behind him? Spurt.
		</p>

		<p>
			The people below were staring at him, one or two were running, and his breath
			was beginning to saw in his throat. The tram was quite near now, and the
			&ldquo;Jolly Cricketers&rdquo; was noisily barring its doors. Beyond the tram
			were posts and heaps of gravel&mdash;the drainage works. He had a transitory
			idea of jumping into the tram and slamming the doors, and then he resolved to
			go for the police station. In another moment he had passed the door of the
			&ldquo;Jolly Cricketers,&rdquo; and was in the blistering fag end of the
			street, with human beings about him. The tram driver and his
			helper&mdash;arrested by the sight of his furious haste&mdash;stood staring
			with the tram horses unhitched. Further on the astonished features of navvies
			appeared above the mounds of gravel.
		</p>

		<p>
			His pace broke a little, and then he heard the swift pad of his pursuer, and
			leapt forward again. &ldquo;The Invisible Man!&rdquo; he cried to the navvies,
			with a vague indicative gesture, and by an inspiration leapt the excavation and
			placed a burly group between him and the chase. Then abandoning the idea of the
			police station he turned into a little side street, rushed by a
			greengrocer&rsquo;s cart, hesitated for the tenth of a second at the door of a
			sweetstuff shop, and then made for the mouth of an alley that ran back into the
			main Hill Street again. Two or three little children were playing here, and
			shrieked and scattered at his apparition, and forthwith doors and windows
			opened and excited mothers revealed their hearts. Out he shot into Hill Street
			again, three hundred yards from the tram-line end, and immediately he became
			aware of a tumultuous vociferation and running people.
		</p>

		<p>
			He glanced up the street towards the hill. Hardly a dozen yards off ran a huge
			navvy, cursing in fragments and slashing viciously with a spade, and hard
			behind him came the tram conductor with his fists clenched. Up the street
			others followed these two, striking and shouting. Down towards the town, men
			and women were running, and he noticed clearly one man coming out of a
			shop-door with a stick in his hand. &ldquo;Spread out! Spread out!&rdquo; cried
			some one. Kemp suddenly grasped the altered condition of the chase. He stopped,
			and looked round, panting. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s close here!&rdquo; he cried.
			&ldquo;Form a line across&mdash;&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He was hit hard under the ear, and went reeling, trying to face round towards
			his unseen antagonist. He just managed to keep his feet, and he struck a vain
			counter in the air. Then he was hit again under the jaw, and sprawled headlong
			on the ground. In another moment a knee compressed his diaphragm, and a couple
			of eager hands gripped his throat, but the grip of one was weaker than the
			other; he grasped the wrists, heard a cry of pain from his assailant, and then
			the spade of the navvy came whirling through the air above him, and struck
			something with a dull thud. He felt a drop of moisture on his face. The grip at
			his throat suddenly relaxed, and with a convulsive effort, Kemp loosed himself,
			grasped a limp shoulder, and rolled uppermost. He gripped the unseen elbows
			near the ground. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got him!&rdquo; screamed Kemp. &ldquo;Help!
			Help&mdash;hold! He&rsquo;s down! Hold his feet!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			In another second there was a simultaneous rush upon the struggle, and a
			stranger coming into the road suddenly might have thought an exceptionally
			savage game of Rugby football was in progress. And there was no shouting after
			Kemp&rsquo;s cry&mdash;only a sound of blows and feet and heavy breathing.
		</p>

		<p>
			Then came a mighty effort, and the Invisible Man threw off a couple of his
			antagonists and rose to his knees. Kemp clung to him in front like a hound to a
			stag, and a dozen hands gripped, clutched, and tore at the Unseen. The tram
			conductor suddenly got the neck and shoulders and lugged him back.
		</p>

		<p>
			Down went the heap of struggling men again and rolled over. There was, I am
			afraid, some savage kicking. Then suddenly a wild scream of &ldquo;Mercy!
			Mercy!&rdquo; that died down swiftly to a sound like choking.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Get back, you fools!&rdquo; cried the muffled voice of Kemp, and there
			was a vigorous shoving back of stalwart forms. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s hurt, I tell
			you. Stand back!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			There was a brief struggle to clear a space, and then the circle of eager faces
			saw the doctor kneeling, as it seemed, fifteen inches in the air, and holding
			invisible arms to the ground. Behind him a constable gripped invisible ankles.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you leave go of en,&rdquo; cried the big navvy, holding a
			blood-stained spade; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s shamming.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not shamming,&rdquo; said the doctor, cautiously raising his
			knee; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll hold him.&rdquo; His face was bruised and already
			going red; he spoke thickly because of a bleeding lip. He released one hand and
			seemed to be feeling at the face. &ldquo;The mouth&rsquo;s all wet,&rdquo; he
			said. And then, &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			He stood up abruptly and then knelt down on the ground by the side of the thing
			unseen. There was a pushing and shuffling, a sound of heavy feet as fresh
			people turned up to increase the pressure of the crowd. People now were coming
			out of the houses. The doors of the &ldquo;Jolly Cricketers&rdquo; stood
			suddenly wide open. Very little was said.
		</p>

		<p>
			Kemp felt about, his hand seeming to pass through empty air. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
			not breathing,&rdquo; he said, and then, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t feel his heart.
			His side&mdash;ugh!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Suddenly an old woman, peering under the arm of the big navvy, screamed
			sharply. &ldquo;Looky there!&rdquo; she said, and thrust out a wrinkled finger.
		</p>

		<p>
			And looking where she pointed, everyone saw, faint and transparent as though it
			was made of glass, so that veins and arteries and bones and nerves could be
			distinguished, the outline of a hand, a hand limp and prone. It grew clouded
			and opaque even as they stared.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; cried the constable. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s his feet
			a-showing!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			And so, slowly, beginning at his hands and feet and creeping along his limbs to
			the vital centres of his body, that strange change continued. It was like the
			slow spreading of a poison. First came the little white nerves, a hazy grey
			sketch of a limb, then the glassy bones and intricate arteries, then the flesh
			and skin, first a faint fogginess, and then growing rapidly dense and opaque.
			Presently they could see his crushed chest and his shoulders, and the dim
			outline of his drawn and battered features.
		</p>

		<p>
			When at last the crowd made way for Kemp to stand erect, there lay, naked and
			pitiful on the ground, the bruised and broken body of a young man about thirty.
			His hair and brow were white&mdash;not grey with age, but white with the
			whiteness of albinism&mdash;and his eyes were like garnets. His hands were
			clenched, his eyes wide open, and his expression was one of anger and dismay.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Cover his face!&rdquo; said a man. &ldquo;For Gawd&rsquo;s sake, cover
			that face!&rdquo; and three little children, pushing forward through the crowd,
			were suddenly twisted round and sent packing off again.
		</p>

		<p>
			Someone brought a sheet from the &ldquo;Jolly Cricketers,&rdquo; and having
			covered him, they carried him into that house. And there it was, on a shabby
			bed in a tawdry, ill-lighted bedroom, surrounded by a crowd of ignorant and
			excited people, broken and wounded, betrayed and unpitied, that Griffin, the
			first of all men to make himself invisible, Griffin, the most gifted physicist
			the world has ever seen, ended in infinite disaster his strange and terrible
			career.

		<h2><a name="chap29"></a>THE EPILOGUE</h2>

		<p>
			So ends the story of the strange and evil experiments of the Invisible Man. And
			if you would learn more of him you must go to a little inn near Port Stowe and
			talk to the landlord. The sign of the inn is an empty board save for a hat and
			boots, and the name is the title of this story. The landlord is a short and
			corpulent little man with a nose of cylindrical proportions, wiry hair, and a
			sporadic rosiness of visage. Drink generously, and he will tell you generously
			of all the things that happened to him after that time, and of how the lawyers
			tried to do him out of the treasure found upon him.
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;When they found they couldn&rsquo;t prove whose money was which,
			I&rsquo;m blessed,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;if they didn&rsquo;t try to make me
			out a blooming treasure trove! Do I <i>look</i> like a Treasure Trove? And then
			a gentleman gave me a guinea a night to tell the story at the Empire Music
			&rsquo;All&mdash;just to tell &rsquo;em in my own words&mdash;barring
			one.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			And if you want to cut off the flow of his reminiscences abruptly, you can
			always do so by asking if there weren&rsquo;t three manuscript books in the
			story. He admits there were and proceeds to explain, with asseverations that
			everybody thinks <i>he</i> has &rsquo;em! But bless you! he hasn&rsquo;t.
			&ldquo;The Invisible Man it was took &rsquo;em off to hide &rsquo;em when I cut
			and ran for Port Stowe. It&rsquo;s that Mr. Kemp put people on with the idea of
			<i>my</i> having &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			And then he subsides into a pensive state, watches you furtively, bustles
			nervously with glasses, and presently leaves the bar.
		</p>

		<p>
			He is a bachelor man&mdash;his tastes were ever bachelor, and there are no
			women folk in the house. Outwardly he buttons&mdash;it is expected of
			him&mdash;but in his more vital privacies, in the matter of braces for example,
			he still turns to string. He conducts his house without enterprise, but with
			eminent decorum. His movements are slow, and he is a great thinker. But he has
			a reputation for wisdom and for a respectable parsimony in the village, and his
			knowledge of the roads of the South of England would beat Cobbett.
		</p>

		<p>
			And on Sunday mornings, every Sunday morning, all the year round, while he is
			closed to the outer world, and every night after ten, he goes into his bar
			parlour, bearing a glass of gin faintly tinged with water, and having placed
			this down, he locks the door and examines the blinds, and even looks under the
			table. And then, being satisfied of his solitude, he unlocks the cupboard and a
			box in the cupboard and a drawer in that box, and produces three volumes bound
			in brown leather, and places them solemnly in the middle of the table. The
			covers are weather-worn and tinged with an algal green&mdash;for once they
			sojourned in a ditch and some of the pages have been washed blank by dirty
			water. The landlord sits down in an armchair, fills a long clay pipe
			slowly&mdash;gloating over the books the while. Then he pulls one towards him
			and opens it, and begins to study it&mdash;turning over the leaves backwards
			and forwards.
		</p>

		<p>
			His brows are knit and his lips move painfully. &ldquo;Hex, little two up in
			the air, cross and a fiddle-de-dee. Lord! what a one he was for
			intellect!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			Presently he relaxes and leans back, and blinks through his smoke across the
			room at things invisible to other eyes. &ldquo;Full of secrets,&rdquo; he says.
			&ldquo;Wonderful secrets!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;Once I get the haul of them&mdash;<i>Lord</i>!&rdquo;
		</p>

		<p>
			&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do what <i>he</i> did; I&rsquo;d
			just&mdash;well!&rdquo; He pulls at his pipe.
		</p>

		<p>
			So he lapses into a dream, the undying wonderful dream of his life. And though
			Kemp has fished unceasingly, no human being save the landlord knows those books
			are there, with the subtle secret of invisibility and a dozen other strange
			secrets written therein. And none other will know of them until he dies.

			The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
			charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
			States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
			considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
			with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
			where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
			DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
			visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

		<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
			While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
			have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
			against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
			approach us with offers to donate.

		<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
			International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
			any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
			outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

			Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
			methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other

			Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
		</div>

		<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
			Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
			Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
			freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
			distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
			volunteer support.
		</div>

		<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
			Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
			editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
			the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
			necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
			edition.
		</div>

		<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
			Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
			facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
		</div>

		<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
			This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
			including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
			Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
			subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
